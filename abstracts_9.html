<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Many autoimmune diseases and other chronic inflammatory disorders are characterized by defective FoxP3(+) regulatory T-cell (Treg) mediated suppression. A potential treatment option for these disorders is to increase the number and activity of Tregs locally. Both PLGA (poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and TMC-TPP (N-trimethyl chitosan tripolyphosphate) nanoparticles (NP) have been described to enhance T cell activation upon nasal application. Since, PLGA NP and TMC-TPP NP differentially affect CD4(+) T-cell differentiation, we investigated in vitro the capacity of both delivery systems to trigger retinoic acid (RA) production in dendritic cells (DCs) as a strategy to enhance the induction of FoxP3(+) T-cells. We generated ovalbumin (OVA)-encapsulated PLGA NP and TMC-TPP NP that were similar in size (400nm) but differed in their surface charge and other physico-chemical properties. We demonstrate that OVA-specific T-cells that are activated by cervical lymph node (CLN)-derived DCs treated with PLGA NP or TMC-TPP NP show more FoxP3 expression than T-cells that are activated by inguinal lymph node (ILN) cells. We demonstrate that only OVA-encapsulated PLGA NP enhance the induction of FoxP3 in activated T-cells via a TGF-β and RA dependent mechanism by enhancing retinaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme (RALDH) expression in CLN-derived DCs that is required for RA production. Additionally, detailed analysis of the CD4(+) T-cell response reveals that PLGA NP induce both IL-10 and IFN-γ production, while TMC-TPP NP induce mainly Th17 production. Underlining that both APC origin and NP characteristics determine the expression level of FoxP3 in activated T-cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that PLGA NP enhance the induction of FoxP3(+) T-cells in the CLN through modulation of DC function and we suggest that they might be a suitable nasal delivery system to treat a wide variety of autoimmune diseases and other chronic inflammatory disorders.
Ischemia followed by reperfusion leads to acute renal failure in both native kidneys and a renal allograft. Our previous study found that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced kidney dysfunction by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether intra-arterial versus intravenous administration was more effective.
Renal ischemia was induced by clamping the right renal vessels for 60 minutes after removal of the left kidney. MSCs (1 × 10(6)) were administered through either the tail vein (TV) or the renal arter (RA), followed by reperfusion. We evaluated kidney function as well as tissue activities of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. To tracking MSCs in vivo, they were transfected with firefly luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein reporter genes (fluc-mrfp). MSC retention and survival were assessed using bioluminescence imaging. We observed the effects of MSCs (1 × 10(6), 2 × 10(6), and 5 × 10(6)) on IR injury.
MSC infusion via either the tail vein or the renal artery significantly improved kidney function at days 1, 3, and 5 as indicated by lower urea and creatinine levels compared with vehicle controls (P &lt; .05). I/R induced a reduction in renal tissue SOD activity but GSH-PX was significantly improved by MSCs (P &lt; .05) on day 1. Treatment with MSCs also significantly reduced renal tissue MDA levels that had been otherwise increased by renal I/R injury (P &lt; .05). The above parameters were similar between the TV and the RA groups. Histological examination revealed kidneys from MSC-treated rats to show fairly normal morphology. The percentages of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were higher in the MSC groups: 16.83 ± 4.62%, 19.17 ± 6.21%, and 2.17 ± 1.16% for the TV, RA, and control groups, respectively. There was no significant dose-related difference among MSC groups. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated most MSCs to be lost within 7 days after either intravenous or intra-arterial infusion.
MSCs ameliorated I/R-induced acute renal failure in rats with similar efficiency whether infused either through the TV or the RA. There was no dose-dependent responses.
PGE2 is a potent lipid mediator of pain and oedema found elevated in RA. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is a terminal enzyme of the PGE2 pathway inducible by proinflammatory cytokines. mPGES-1 is markedly upregulated in RA synovial tissue despite antirheumatic treatments, suggesting that multiple inflammatory stimuli contribute to its induction. High-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is known to induce inflammation both by direct interaction with TLR4 and by enhancement of other proinflammatory molecules signalling, through complex formation. The high expression of extracellular HMGB1 within the inflamed synovium, implies its pro-arthritogenic role in RA. We aimed to investigate the effects of IL-1β/HMGB1 complexes on mPGES-1 and other enzymes of the PGE2 pathway in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) from patients with arthritis. Furthermore, we studied the effect of COX-2 inhibition and IL-1RI antagonism on prostanoid and cytokine production by SFs. Stimulation of SFs with HMGB1 in complex with suboptimal amounts of IL-1β significantly increased mPGES-1 and COX-2 expressions as well as PGE2 production, as compared to treatment with HMGB1 or IL-1β alone. Furthermore, NS-398 reduced the production of IL-6 and IL-8, thus indicating that IL-1β/HMGB1 complexes modulate cytokine production in part through prostanoid synthesis. Treatment with IL-1RA completely abolished the induced PGE2 and cytokine production, suggesting an effect mediated through IL-1RI. IL-1β/HMGB1 complexes promote the induction of mPGES-1, COX-2 and PGE2 in SF. The amplification of the PGE2 biosynthesis pathway by HMGB1 might constitute an important pathogenic mechanism perpetuating inflammatory and destructive activities in rheumatoid arthritis.
The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of the T-786C polymorphism and intron 4 27 bp variable number tandem repeat(VNTR) eNOS markers for their potential association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE), Hashimotos thyroiditis(HT) and Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) as well as to explore their effect on eNOS mRNA expression and nitrate production(NOx). Kuwaitis (n=383) matched by age, gender and ethnicity were genotyped by fluorescent-labelled-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and fragment analysis. Expression of eNOS mRNA was analysed using RT-PCR and sera from subjects were screened for NOx using ELISA. Analysis of the allelic frequency revealed a significant association of the 4b allele with susceptibility to SLE (p=0.0092, OR=1.76). The 4bb genotype was found to be associated with SLE (p=0.0076, OR=1.97) and HT (p=0.05, OR=1.81). Allelic and genotypic distribution did not differ between RA patients and healthy control subjects. The 4bb genotype resulted in reduced expression of eNOS mRNA in SLE, RA and HT, but only the reduction in HT was significant (p=0.05). The 4ab genotype revealed a significant association with increased eNOS expression in HT (p=0.03) and RA (p=0.014) patients, and elevated NOx levels were detected in the autoimmune disease cohorts (p&lt; 0.05) when compared to healthy control subjects. The T-786C SNP failed to show a significant association (p&gt; 0.05) with SLE, HT, and RA patients. This study is the first to reveal a significant association between the 4bb genotype of the 27 bp VNTR and susceptibility to HT. The expression of eNOS is related to the number of 27 bp repeats, with heterozygous 4bb repeats showing a decrease in eNOS expression.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, which are clinically present as 1 of the 2 disorders, Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) (Rogler 2004). The immune dysregulation in the intestine plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD, involving a wide range of molecules, including cytokines. The aim of this work was to study the involvement of T-helper 17 (Th17) subset in the bowel disease pathogenesis by the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in Algerian patients with IBD. We investigated the correlation between the proinflammatory cytokines [(interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23, and IL-6] and NO production in 2 groups of patients. We analyzed the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding Th17 cytokines, cytokine receptors, and NO synthase 2 (NOS2) in plasma of the patients. In the same way, the expression of p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NOS2 was measured by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. We also studied NO modulation by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α, or IL-1β) in the presence or absence of all-trans retinoic acid (At RA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, and in colonic mucosa cultures. Analysis of cytokines, cytokine receptors, and NOS2 transcripts revealed that the levels of mRNA transcripts of the indicated genes are elevated in all IBD groups. Our study shows a significant positive correlation between the NO and IL-17A, IL-23, and IL-6 levels in plasma of the patients with IBD. Interestingly, the correlation is significantly higher in patients with active CD. Our study shows that both p-STAT3 and inducible NOS expression was upregulated in PBMCs and colonic mucosa, especially in patients with active CD. At RA downregulates NO production in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines for the 2 groups of patients. Collectively, our study indicates that the IL-23/IL-17A axis plays a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis through the NO pathway.
Cigarette smoking is a major established environmental risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and synoviocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. We have reported that aryl hydrocarbon or cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) is able to upregulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines from an RA patient-derived synovial fibroblast cell line MH7A. In this study, we compared the effect of CSC on induction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from RA or osteoarthritis (OA) patient-derived synovial fibroblasts, and studied the mechanism of the effect of CSC. CSC induced IL-1β mRNA from RA patient-derived synoviocytes and MH7A, but not from OA patient-derived synoviocytes. CSC induced the mRNA and both precursor and mature forms of IL-1β, and caspase-1 activity in MH7A. The mechanism of CSC-induced IL-1β mRNA expression was investigated in MH7A. Reporter gene analyses and promoter pull-down assay indicated that 3 novel NF-κB sites at -3771 to -3762 bp, -3105 to -3096 bp, and -2787 to -2778 bp in the promoter region of the IL-1β gene, especially the far distal NF-κB site and NF-κB activation, are critical for the gene activation by CSC. CSC-induced NF-κB activation, IL-1β promoter activity, IL-1β mRNA upregulation, and CYP1A1 mRNA induction were all inhibited by an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist α-naphthoflavone. These results indicate that CSC induced IL-1β production from RA patient-derived synoviocytes, but not OA patient-derived synoviocytes, through AhR-dependent NF-κB activation and novel NF-κB sites.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common arthritis and is mainly characterized by symmetric polyarticular joint disorders. Our previous study demonstrated a novel small molecule compound (Z)-N-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2-(4-((2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) acet-amide (SKLB023) showed potently anti-arthritic effects in a rat arthritis model, however, the underlying mechanisms for this are largely unknown. Both NF-κB and macrophages were reported to play important roles in the pathologic processes of RA. The purposes of this study were to indicate whether NF-κB and macrophages contributed to anti-arthritic effects of SKLB023 in two experimental arthritis models. Our results showed that SKLB023 could significantly improve joint inflammation and cartilage destruction both in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models. We further found that the binding activation of NF-κB to DNA in joint tissues and RAW264.7 macrophages were suppressed by SKLB023. SKLB023 also inhibited the NF-κB activity in peritoneal macrophages by luciferase assay. Furthermore, the number of macrophages in synovial tissues was decreased after the treatment of different doses of SKLB023. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in plasma, and the levels of TNF-α, NO, and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages were down-regulated by SKLB023. Finally, SKLB023 attenuated the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in vivo and suppressed the phosphorylations of components of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These observations identify a novel function for SKLB023 as an inhibitor of NF-κB in macrophages of RA, highlighting that SKLB023 was a potential therapeutic strategy for RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent signaling molecule that plays pleiotropic roles in patterning, morphogenesis, and organogenesis during embryonic development. The synthesis from retinol (vitamin A) to retinoic acid requires two sequential oxidative steps. The first step involves the oxidation of retinol to retinal through the action of retinol dehydrogenases. Retinol dehydrogenases1l (RDH1l) is a novel zebrafish retinol dehydrogenase. Herein we investigated the role of zebrafish RDH1l in heart development and cardiac performance in detail.
RDH1l specific morpholino was used to reduce the function of RDH1l in zebrafish. The gene expressions were observed by using whole mount in situ hybridization. Heart rates were observed and recorded under the microscope from 24 to 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). The cardiac performance was analyzed by measuring ventricular shortening fraction (VSF).
The knock-down of RDH1l led to abnormal neural crest cells migration and reduced numbers of neural crest cells in RDH1l morphant embryos. The reduced numbers of cardiac neural crest cells also can be seen in RDH1l morphant embryos. Furthermore, the morpholino-mediated knock-down of RDH1l resulted in the abnormal heart loop. The left-right determining genes expression pattern was altered in RDH1l morphant embryos. The impaired cardiac performance was observed in RDH1l morphant embryos. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RDH1l is essential for the heart development and cardiac performance in zebrafish.
RDH1l plays a important role in the neural crest cells development, and then ultimately affects the heart loop and cardiac performance. These results show for the first time that an enzyme involved in the retinol to retinaldehyde conversion participate in the heart development and cardiac performance in zebrafish.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream pro-inflammatory cytokine that is associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two polymorphisms in the upstream region exist in the MIF gene and are associated with RA susceptibility or severity in different populations. In this case-control study, we investigated whether MIF polymorphisms are associated with RA susceptibility or activity in a western Mexican population .The relationship of MIF levels with clinical features of disease also was assessed. Genotyping of the -794 CATT5-8 (rs5844572) and the -173 G&gt;C (rs755622) polymorphisms was performed by PCR and PCR-RFLP respectively on 226 RA patients and 210 healthy subjects. Serum MIF levels were determined by ELISA. We found a significant association between the -794 CATT5-8 6,7 MIF genotype with RA. Moreover, we detected an association between the -794 CATT7 allele with early onset RA. The -794 CATT7 and -173(*)C alleles, which are in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with high disease activity on RA patients. A positive correlation between circulating MIF levels and C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein/peptides antibodies and TNFα was detected. MIF levels appear to be associated with disease progression rather than disease activity, which is distinct from the established relationship between disease activity and TNFα levels. In conclusion, the MIF gene and protein are associated with RA in a western Mexican population, with a main contribution onto early onset and early stages of disease.
Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate drug, is the first-line disease-modifying agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) worldwide. MTX has excellent long-term efficacy, tolerability and safety. Early initiation of MTX in patients with RA controls joint destruction and slows progression of disease. However, the clinical response to MTX and frequency of adverse effects from the drug exhibit marked interpatient variability. Over the past decade, there has been a quest to identify genetic markers that reliably predict MTX efficacy and toxicity and help optimize MTX therapy in RA; that is, the field of MTX pharmacogenetics. This review will summarize key pharmacogenetic studies examining SNPs in the genes encoding enzymes in the MTX cellular pathway and their association with MTX response in RA. As evident from this review, MTX pharmacogenetics in RA remains a muddled field, mostly due to inconsistent results from several small underpowered studies.
Taurine (TAU) has a lot of the biological, physiological, and pharmocological functions including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress. Although previous studies have appreciated the effectiveness of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) on the delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), consistent finding has not still convinced. The aim of this study was to examine the additional effect of TAU with BCAA on the DOMS and muscle damages after eccentric exercise. Thirty-six untrained male volunteers were equally divided into four groups, and ingested a combination with 2.0 g TAU (or placebo) and 3.2 g BCAA (or placebo), thrice a day, 2 weeks prior to and 4 days after elbow flexion eccentric exercise. Following the period after eccentric exercise, the physiological and blood biochemical markers for DOMS and muscle damage showed improvement in the combination of TAU and BCAA supplementation rather than in the single or placebo supplementations. In conclusion, additional supplement of TAU with BCAA would be a useful way to attenuate DOMS and muscle damages induced by high-intensity exercise.
In the brain, retinoic acid (RA) concentrations are under tight spatio-temporal control. Here, we show that challenge of primary mouse microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in increased release of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Co-administration of RA attenuated microglial activation. Similarly, pretreatment with RA-metabolism inhibitor liarozole potently reduced NO and TNF-α release. Conversely, activated microglia showed increased protein expression of RA-degrading cytochromes CYP26A1, CYP26B1, CYP3A4 and CYP2C. Correspondingly, RA catabolism by activated microglia was significantly increased. Our results indicate that RA reduces microglial activation, but also, conversely, that the activation state of microglia influences RA metabolism.
The beneficial or adverse effects of isolated phytochemicals are not always concordant with effects of the botanical dietary supplements from which they were derived. This disparity could be due to interactions between the various phytochemicals present in the whole plant. The phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) are widely present in foods and dietary supplements, and they are assumed to exert various beneficial biological effects. However, there is little data on the potential biological interactions of these three phenolic acids which commonly occur together and are linked metabolically. In the present study, liver toxicity of the three phenolic acids was assessed on the three compounds singly and in various binary and one ternary combinations. A series of in vitro endpoints relevant to liver toxicity were evaluated in both a human (HepG2/C3A) and rat (MH1C1) hepatocyte cell line. The Combination Index (CI) was calculated for each endpoint from both the concentration responses of the single compounds and the responses of the various binary and ternary mixtures. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed for some endpoints and some combinations of test agents. Interactions were most prevalent in measures of oxidative stress and cytochrome P450 activities in both cell types. There was only a 53% concordance between the rat and human cells which may be suggestive of species differences. The data suggest an approach for better characterizing the beneficial or adverse effects of complex botanical products through evaluation of interactions between individual phytochemical components.
Phagocyte-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory high density lipoprotein (HDL) associate with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the link between MPO and HDL has not been systematically examined. In this study, we investigated whether MPO can oxidise HDL and determined MPO-specific oxidative signature by apoA-1 by peptide mapping in RA subjects with and without known cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Two MPO oxidation products, 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine, were quantified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in in vitro model system studies and in plasma and HDL derived from healthy controls and RA subjects. MPO levels and cholesterol efflux were determined. Site-specific nitration and chlorination of apoA-1 peptides were quantified by MS/MS.
RA subjects demonstrated higher levels of MPO, MPO-oxidised HDL and diminished cholesterol efflux. There was marked increase in MPO-specific 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine content in HDL in RA subjects consistent with specific targeting of HDL, with increased nitration in RA subjects with CVD. Cholesterol efflux capacity was diminished in RA subjects and correlated inversely with HDL 3-chlorotyrosine suggesting a mechanistic role for MPO. Nitrated HDL was elevated in RACVD subjects compared with RA subjects without CVD. Oxidative peptide mapping revealed site-specific unique oxidation signatures on apoA-1 for RA subjects with and without CVD.
We report an increase in MPO-mediated HDL oxidation that is regiospecific in RA and accentuated in those with CVD. Decreased cholesterol efflux capacity due to MPO-mediated chlorination is a potential mechanism for atherosclerosis in RA and raises the possibility that oxidant resistant forms of HDL may attenuate this increased risk.
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between complaints of xerostomia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the total output of the salivary proteins of innate and adaptive immunity.
The salivary output and specific activity of peroxidase and specific contents of lysozyme, lactoferrin, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were determined in xerostomic RA patients, nonxerostomic RA patients, and healthy control subjects.
Compared with nonxerostomic RA and healthy control groups, xerostomic RA patients had significantly decreased output of saliva and protein, decreased peroxidase activity, and a significantly lower specific content of peroxidase and sIgA. Compared with the RA control group, xerostomic RA patients had significantly lower specific content of all salivary proteins examined.
The results indicate that xerostomia in patients with RA may be a harbinger of diminished saliva production regarding quantity and quality, and may be indicative of impairment of the salivary immune system of the oral cavity in xerostomic RA patients.
Recent studies showed that adenosine played important roles in vasodilation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of adenosine, its A1 and A2b receptor agonists on pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) induced by chronic hypoxia in rats by continuously subcutaneous administration with an osmotic pump for 14 days, and to see if rennin angiotensin system and inducible nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) mediate the effects.
Fifty-six male SD rats were randomly assigned to seven groups. Each group included eight rats. They were normoxic group, hypoxic group, adenosine-treated group [adenosine was administered at a dose of 150 µg(kg·min) under the hypoxic condition], adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA-treated group [CPA was administered at a dose of 20 µg/(kg·min) under the hypoxic condition], CPA plus selective adenosine A1 antagonist DPCPX-treated group [CPA and DPCPX were administered simultaneously under the hypoxic condition, the dose of CPA was the same as the above, and the dose of DPCPX was 25 µg/(kg·min)], adenosine A2b receptor agonist NECA-treated group [NECA was administered at a dose of 30 µg/(kg·min) under the hypoxic condition], NECA plus selective adenosine A2b receptor antagonist MRS-treated group[ NECA and MRS1754 were administered simultaneously under the hypoxic condition, the dose of NECA was the same as the above, and the dose of MRS1754 was 50 µg/(kg·min)]. Osmotic pumps containing adenosine or selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist (CPA), or nonselective but potent adenosine A2b receptor agonist (NECA) were placed subcutaneously 7 days after hypoxia and continuously administered the agents for 14 days.Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was detected after administration of the agents. Then blood samples were taken from heart for measurement of renin activity, angiotensin II (AngII) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration by radioimmunoassay, NO by measuring nitrate. Small pulmonary arteries were prepared for immunoreactivity staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and iNOS.
(1) Chronic hypoxia induced PAH [mPAP: (31.38 ± 3.42) mm Hg]. Adenosine or CPA or NECA administered for 14 days by subcutaneous route attenuated the mPAP [(21.17 ± 3.56) mm Hg, (22.88 ± 2.95) mm Hg, (19.81 ± 2.39) mm Hg, respectively], which showed significant difference when compared with hypoxia group (P &lt; 0.05 respectively). (2) Plasma rennin activity and AngII level in hypoxia group [(2.51 ± 0.25) ng/(ml·h), (83.01 ± 9.38) pg/ml] were significantly higher than that in normoxic group (P &lt; 0.05, respectively).(3) Adenosine treatment decreased the rennin activity and AngII level when compared with hypoxic group(P &lt; 0.05, respectively);CPA and NECA attenuated respectively the rennin activity and AngII level of rats induced by chronic hypoxia (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). (4) Adenosine administration for 14 days attenuated the wall thickness induced by chronic hypoxia (P &lt; 0.05). CPA showed no effect on wall thickness, but NECA significantly attenuated the wall thickness (P &lt; 0.05). (5) The number of iNOS staining positive cells in small pulmonary artery was higher in hypoxia group than in that in normoxic rats (23.75 ± 7.91 vs. 8.00 ± 2.20, P &lt; 0.05). Adenosine or CPA, or NECA administration increased respectively the iNOS expression in rats treated with chronic hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia caused significant decrease of nitric oxide level. Adenosine treatment increased the nitric oxide level in rats treated with chronic hypoxia. CPA and NECA also increased respectively the nitric oxide level in rats treated with chronic hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia caused significant increase of ET-1 level. The ET-1 level in rats treated with adenosine, CPA or NCEA respectively were lower than that in chronic hypoxia rats (P &lt; 0.05). (6) Adenosine treatment partially attenuated the number of PCNA-positively stained cells. NECA treatment also attenuated the PCNA expression, but CPA showed no effect.
Adenosine and its agonists CPA, NECA administered continually by subcutaneous route attenuate mPAP of rats induced by chronic hypoxia. CPA attenuates mPAP through reduction of RA/AngII activity and balance of NO/ET-1 level. NECA attenuates mPAP by inhibiting PCNA expression and proliferation of mooth muscle of pulmonary artery.
The Hox1 gene in the urochordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis (Ci-Hox1) is expressed in the nerve cord and epidermis. We identified a nerve cord enhancer in the second intron of Ci-Hox1, and demonstrated that retinoic acid (RA) plays a major role in activating this enhancer. The enhancer contained a putative retinoic acid-response element (RARE). Mutation of the RARE in the Ci-Hox1 nerve cord enhancer only partially abolished the enhancer activity. Genes encoding RA synthase and the RA receptor were knocked down using specific antisense morpholino oligos (MOs), and injection of embryos with these MOs resulted in the complete disappearance of epidermal expression of Ci-Hox1 and reduction of neural expression. However, nerve cord expression was not completely repressed. These results suggest that the nerve cord enhancer is activated by two partially redundant pathways; one RA-dependent and one RA-independent.
Investigations have suggested degradation of native hyaluronan (HA) into small oligosaccharides as being involved in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Inflammatory responses occur by modulating the TLR4 and 2, and the CD44 natural HA receptor. As reported recently, the adenosine A2 receptor (A2AR) plays an important anti-inflammatory role in arthritis. TLR4, TLR2 and CD44 stimulation activate NF-κB, which stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators. In contrast, A2AR stimulation inhibits NF-κB activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combined treatment of HA inhibitor Pep-1 and a selective A2AR agonist (CV-1808) in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Arthritis was induced via intradermal injection of bovine collagen-II. Mice were treated with Pep-1 plus CV-1808 intraperitoneally daily for 20 d. CIA increased TLR4, TLR2, CD44 and A2AR mRNA expression and the related proteins in the joint cartilage of arthritic mice, where significantly increased concentrations were of TNF-α, IL-1-β, IL-17, matrix metalloprotease-13 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Pep-1 with CV-1808 treatment significantly reduced CIA damage and all the up-regulated biochemical parameters. These reductions were supported by microscopic analysis and synovial fluid HA levels. 
Cytotoxic 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions induced in DNA and RNA in vitro and in pre-damaged DNA and RNA bacteriophages in vivo are repaired by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) protein AlkB and a human homolog, ALKBH3. However, it is not known whether endogenous RNA is repaired in vivo by repair proteins present at physiological concentrations. The concept of RNA repair as a biologically relevant process has therefore remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate AlkB-mediated repair of endogenous RNA in vivo by measuring differences in lesion-accumulation in two independent AlkB-proficient and deficient E. coli strains during exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Repair was observed both in AlkB-overproducing strains and in the wild-type strains after AlkB induction. RNA repair appeared to be highest in RNA species below 200 nucleotides in size, mainly comprising tRNAs. Strikingly, at least 10-fold more lesions were repaired in RNA than in DNA. This may be a consequence of some 30-fold higher levels of aberrant methylation in RNA than in DNA after exposure to MMS. A high primary kinetic isotope effect (&gt;10) was measured using a deuterated methylated RNA substrate, D3-1me(rA), demonstrating that it is the catalytic step, and not the search step that is rate-limiting. Our results demonstrate that RNA repair by AlkB takes place in endogenous RNA as part of an adaptive response in wild-type E. coli cells.
Retinoic acid (RA), an active vitamin A derivative, is essential for mammalian spermatogenesis. Genetic studies have revealed that oxidation of vitamin A to retinal by retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) is critical for embryonic RA biosynthesis. However, physiological roles of RDH10 in postnatal RA synthesis remain unclear, given that Rdh10 loss-of-function mutations lead to early embryonic lethality. We conducted in vivo genetic studies of Rdh10 in postnatal mouse testes and found that an RDH10 deficiency in Sertoli cells, but not in germ cells, results in a mild germ cell depletion phenotype. A deficiency of RDH10 in both Sertoli and germ cells in juvenile mice results in a blockage of spermatogonial differentiation, similar to that seen in vitamin A-deficient animals. This defect in spermatogenesis arises from a complete deficiency in juvenile testicular RA synthesis and can be rescued by retinoid administration. Thus, in juvenile mice, the primary, but not exclusive, source of RA in the testes is Sertoli cells. In contrast, adult Rdh10-deficient mice exhibit phenotypically normal spermatogenesis, indicating that during development a change occurs in either the cellular source of RA or the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase involved in RA synthesis.
Vitamin D deficiency seems to be involved in the development and severity of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To evaluate the influence of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3) on aromatase expression in cultures of human macrophages, as a new target for vitamin D cell modulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
Cultures of human monocytic THP-1 cells were activated to macrophages and treated for 24 hours with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8M), 17β-estradiol (E2, 10-8M) both alone and in combination, in order to evaluate the effects on the intracrine estrogen metabolism. Untreated human macrophages were used as controls (basal). P450-aromatase synthesis was evaluated by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and western blot analysis (WB). The expression of P450-aromatase gene (CYP19A1) was investigated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1-β, IL-6 and TNF-α were evaluated by ELISA and WB.
In E2 untreated condition, 1,25(OH)2D3 reduced P450-aromatase synthesis and CYP19A1 gene expression in cultured cells. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL1-β, IL-6 and TNF-α) was significantly reduced by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment (p&lt;0.001 vs. basal for all cytokines). However, 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to significantly downregulate the E2-mediated increase in P450-aromatase synthesis and gene expression (p&lt;0.001 for both vs. E2-treated macrophages), as well as the production of all pro-inflammatory cytokines (p&lt;0.001 vs. E2-treated cells).
Our data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 may downregulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human activated macrophages by significantly decreasing the aromatase activity, especially in presence of an estrogenic milieu such as in the RA synovial tissue.
The expression of receptor activator of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) and that of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) are closely related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our aim was to confirm whether MSRA and RANKL polymorphisms play a role in RA in a Chinese population.
We investigated the presence of MSRA rs10903323 G/A and RANKL rs7984870 C/G polymorphisms in 329 patients with RA and 697 controls in a Chinese population. Genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
When the MSRA rs10903323 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the GA genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for RA. In the dominant model, when the MSRA rs10903323 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the GA/AA genotypes were associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to RA. The RANKL rs7984870 C/G polymorphism was not associated with a risk for RA. In stratification analyses, a significantly increased risk for RA associated with the MSRA rs10903323 GA genotype was evident among male patients, older patients, C-reactive protein (CRP)-positive patients, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) negative patients compared with the MSRA rs10903323 GG genotype.
These findings suggest that the MSRA rs10903323 G/A variant allele is associated with RA development, especially among male patients, older patients, CRP-positive patients, and anti-CCP negative patients.
The significance of non-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies in patients with RA is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess associations of autoantibodies with autoimmune risk alleles and with clinical diagnoses from the electronic medical records (EMRs) among RA cases and non-RA controls.
Data on 1,290 RA cases and 1,236 non-RA controls of European genetic ancestry were obtained from the EMRs of 2 large academic centers. The levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (AGTAs), and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were measured. All subjects were genotyped for autoimmune risk alleles, and the association between number of autoimmune risk alleles present and number of types of autoantibodies present was studied. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was conducted to study potential associations between autoantibodies and clinical diagnoses among RA cases and non-RA controls.
The mean ages were 60.7 years in RA cases and 64.6 years in non-RA controls. The proportion of female subjects was 79% in each group. The prevalence of ACPAs and ANAs was higher in RA cases compared to controls (each P &lt; 0.0001); there were no differences in the prevalence of anti-TPO antibodies and AGTAs. Carriage of higher numbers of autoimmune risk alleles was associated with increasing numbers of autoantibody types in RA cases (P = 2.1 × 10(-5)) and non-RA controls (P = 5.0 × 10(-3)). From the PheWAS, the presence of ANAs was significantly associated with a diagnosis of Sjögren's/sicca syndrome in RA cases.
The increased frequency of autoantibodies in RA cases and non-RA controls was associated with the number of autoimmune risk alleles carried by an individual. PheWAS of EMR data, with linkage to laboratory data obtained from blood samples, provide a novel method to test for the clinical significance of biomarkers in disease.
Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, exerts pleiotropic effects throughout life in vertebrate organisms. Thus, RA action must be tightly regulated through the coordinated action of biosynthetic and degrading enzymes. The last step of retinoic acid biosynthesis is irreversibly catalyzed by the NAD-dependent retinal dehydrogenases (RALDH), which are members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. Low intracellular retinal concentrations imply efficient substrate molecular recognition to ensure high affinity and specificity of RALDHs for retinal. This study addresses the molecular basis of retinal recognition in human ALDH1A1 (or RALDH1) and rat ALDH1A2 (or RALDH2), through the comparison of the catalytic behavior of retinal analogs and use of the fluorescence properties of retinol. We show that, in contrast to long chain unsaturated substrates, the rate-limiting step of retinal oxidation by RALDHs is associated with acylation. Use of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer upon retinol interaction with RALDHs provides evidence that retinal recognition occurs in two steps: binding into the substrate access channel, and a slower structural reorganization with a rate constant of the same magnitude as the kcat for retinal oxidation: 0.18 vs. 0.07 and 0.25 vs. 0.1 s(-1) for ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2, respectively. This suggests that the conformational transition of the RALDH-retinal complex significantly contributes to the rate-limiting step that controls the kinetics of retinal oxidation, as a prerequisite for the formation of a catalytically competent Michaelis complex. This conclusion is consistent with the general notion that structural flexibility within the active site of ALDH enzymes has been shown to be an integral component of catalysis.
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with unknown pathophysiology involving many interwoven signalling cascades. ROS, NK and NKT cells might be crucial in the disease severity of RA of which the role of NK and NKT cells are controversial in literature. However, the role of oxidative stress, its impact on NK and NKT cell immunobiology and disease activity (DAS28) is largely unknown. Therefore, we studied the role of oxidative stress and NK cell subsets in the pathogenesis of RA. The state of oxidative stress in various peripheral blood fractions, percentage NK and NKT cell expression, their altered apoptotic signaling pathways involving mitochondrial membrane potential, FAS associated death domain (FADD) mediated pathways and DNA damage were analyzed. Results indicated a state of profound oxidative stress in the peripheral blood of RA patients where percentage of NK and NKT cell subsets diminished while ROS levels increased. The depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, FAS, FASL and active caspase-3 positive NK and NKT cell subsets were considerably elevated in patients. The DNA damage, assessed as percentage of DNA in comet tail, was significantly elevated. Findings of the present work indicate increased apoptosis of peripheral NK and NKT cells in the diseased condition. PBMC and RBC are the major sites of enhanced oxidative stress. The state of oxidative stress and altered immunobiology of NK and NKT cells strongly correlated with Disease activity score. The present study strongly supports the protective role of NK cell subsets in the pathogenesis of RA.
Fifty-three women, including 32 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (a study group) and 21 individuals (a control group), were examined. In the study and control group, the patients' mean age was 49 +/- 7.4 and 47 +/- 9 years, respectively. The coronary arteries were examined using a GE LightSpeed VCT 64-slice computed tomograph. Coronary calcium was measured by SmartScore software; calcium index was determined by the Agatston score. Coronary artery changes were diagnosed in 44 and 19% in the study and control groups, respectively. Coronary artery calcification was detected in 27% of the patients with RA. In the latter, there was a predominance of multiple coronary artery lesions with more severe stenosis and a number of atherosclerotic plaques. Hemodynamically relevant stenoses were diagnosed only in patients with RA. Coronary artery atherosclerosis was found to be associated with the duration of menopause, the higher levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, the lower levels of superoxide dismutase, the high activity of RA and the number of involved joints. The degree of coronary stenosis is associated with the level of systolic blood pressure.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective loss of motor neurons which leads to progressive paralysis and death by respiratory failure. Although the cause of sporadic ALS is still unknown, oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disease and of the rare familial form, which often exhibits mutations of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Since enhanced iron levels are discussed to participate in oxidative stress and neuronal death, we analyzed the expression levels of Fe-related mRNAs in a cell culture ALS model with the G93A mutation of SOD1. We observed an increased total iron content in G93A-SOD1 SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells compared to wild-type (WT)-SOD1 cells. mRNA expression for transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter 1 was increased in G93A-SOD1 cells, which was in accordance with higher iron uptake. Experiments with the iron chelator deferoxamine revealed a normal reaction of WT and mutant cells to cytoplasmic iron depletion, i.e. TfR1 upregulation, suggesting a basically conserved function of the iron-responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) pathway, designed to adapt gene expression to iron levels. Expression levels of mitoferrin 1 and 2, frataxin, and iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein were also significantly increased in G93A-SOD1 cells, suggesting higher mitochondrial iron import and utilization in biosynthetic pathways within the mitochondria. Moreover, expression of these transcripts was further enhanced, if G93A-SOD1 cells were differentiated by retinoic acid (RA). Since RA treatment increased cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in these cells, an IRE/IRP independent, ROS-mediated mechanism may account for dysregulation of iron-related genes.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have recently been identified as an important mediator in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases through the production of arginase (Arg)-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and evaluate their correlation with T-helper (Th)17 cells.
The frequency of MDSCs and Th17 cells and the mRNA expression of transcriptional factor RORγ-t and iNOS in the peripheral blood of RA patients and healthy controls (HC) were determined by flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and Arg-1 were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
Compared with HC, both the prevalence of circulating MDSCs and plasma Arg-1 increased significantly in RA patients. However, no significant difference was observed in the mRNA level of iNOS between RA patients and HC. The frequency of Th17 cells in RA patients was significantly higher than in HC but correlated negatively with the frequency of MDSCs and plasma Arg-1. A negative correlation between MDSCs and plasma TNF-α was also observed. However, the frequency of MDSCs was not correlated with plasma IL-6 and IL-17, nor with the mRNA level of RORγ-t.
We found a negative correlation between increased circulating MDSCs and Th17 cells in RA patients, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in RA.
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid which influences a wide range of physiological processes, including mood, cognition, and immunity. In the autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the induction of tryptophan catabolism may help to diminish exacerbated immune responses. In this study, using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice which is an animal model of RA, the endogenous activity of the kynurenine pathway in the immune system was monitored before and after onset of the disease. An increased rate of the initiation of tryptophan catabolism via the kynurenine pathway throughout CIA has been observed. However, decreased tryptophan concentration in the lymph nodes from pre-arthritic mice was not enough to prevent development of CIA. In contrast, resolution of inflammation coincided with the decreased concentration of tryptophan and accumulation of its catabolites: kynurenine, anthranilic acid, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid in lymph nodes but not in the spleen. In addition, the lack of the accumulation of kynurenine and its downstream metabolites in the pre-arthritic lymph nodes coincided with increased mRNA expression for genes involved in the catabolism of kynurenine (Kynureninase, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, and 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4 dioxygenase). However, in the lymph nodes from mice with established CIA, mRNA expression for these genes was normalized. Hence, keeping in mind an exploratory character of the results, it can be postulated that an anti-inflammatory role of the kynurenine pathway reaches its full potential only when decreased concentration of tryptophan coincides with accumulation of kynurenines driven by metabolic regulation of gene expression on the kynurenine pathway.
The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural phenolic, in the treatment of acute liver toxicity. RA at 10, 25 and 50mg/kg was administered by gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days, 6h after CCl(4) intoxication. CCl(4) intoxication caused hepatic necrosis and increased serum ALT activity. In the livers, oxidative/nitrosative stress was evidenced by increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation and a significant decrease in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. CCl(4) administration triggered inflammatory response in mice livers by activating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), which coincided with the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RA improved histological and serum markers of liver damage and significantly ameliorated oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue. Additionally, RA prevented transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, suggesting suppression of profibrotic response. Furthermore, RA significantly inhibited the CCl(4)-induced apoptosis, which was evident from decreased cleavage of caspase-3. The hepatoprotective activity of RA coincided with enhanced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. The results of this study indicates that RA possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic activity against acute liver toxicity.
Retinoic acid (RA) is an essential component for development and maintenance of the male genital tract and for spermatogenesis. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1, cytochrome P450 (CYP)26b1, RA receptor (RAR)α, cellular RA-binding protein (CRAB)II, and stimulated by RA gene (STRA)8 are involved in synthesis, metabolism signaling pathways, and as downstream effectors of RA. The objective was to elucidate the effects of exogenous RA and a RARα antagonist on gene expression of ALDH1, CYP26b1, RARα, cellular RA-binding protein II, and STRA8 in an in vitro organ culture model of canine testis. Testicular tissues from medium-sized mixed breed dogs (N = 5; age 8 ± 0.17 mo) were subjected to exogenous all trans-RA (final concentrations of 1, 2, and 10 μM, and DMSO as control) for 24 h. Similarly, testicular tissues were treated with Ro 41-5253 (RARα antagonist), at 1, 10, and 50 μM final concentrations (DMSO as control) for 24 h. Exogenous RA or the RARα antagonist decreased (P &lt; 0.05) mRNA abundance of ALDH1 in a dose-dependent manner compared with control. The CRABII mRNA abundance was greater after RA treatment compared with control (P &lt; 0.01), but only 50 μM Ro 41-5253 effectively decreased CRABII mRNA abundance compared with control (P &lt; 0.01). Although RA did not affect RARα mRNA abundance, the RARα antagonist treatment lowered RARα mRNA abundance compared with control (P &lt; 0.05). Abundance of CYP26b1and STRA8 mRNA were greater (P &lt; 0.05) after RA treatment, but lower (P &lt; 0.05) after RARα antagonist treatment compared with control. In conclusion, exogenous RA decreased mRNA abundance of ALDH1 and increased mRNA abundance of RA signaling molecules and its downstream effectors (CYP26b1, CRABII, and STRA8), whereas treatment with a RARα antagonist effectively decreased RARα and RA metabolism molecules and its downstream effectors in canine testis. Perhaps pharmacological intervention via the RA pathway would enable canine male contraception or treatment of testicular pathology.
Poly-(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is a catabolic enzyme that cleaves ADP-ribose polymers synthesized by poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Here, transcriptome profiling and differentiation assay revealed a requirement of PARG for retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcription. Mechanistically, PARG accumulates early at promoters of RAR-responsive genes upon retinoic acid treatment to promote the formation of an appropriate chromatin environment suitable for transcription. Silencing of PARG or knockout of its enzymatic activity maintains the H3K9me2 mark at the promoter of the RAR-dependent genes, leading to the absence of preinitiation complex formation. In the absence of PARG, we found that the H3K9 demethylase KDM4D/JMJD2D became PARsylated. Mutation of two glutamic acids located in the Jumonji N domain of KDM4D inhibited PARsylation. PARG becomes dispensable for ligand-dependent transcription when either a PARP inhibitor or a non-PARsylable KDM4D/JMJD2D mutant is used. Our results define PARG as a coactivator regulating chromatin remodeling during RA-dependent gene expression.
Abstract   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common illness of global significance for public health. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most broadly used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of RA, but it displays marked person-to-person variation in its propensity for toxicity. Several studies have suggested that polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, reduced folate carrier (RFC1) G80A, and ABCB1 C3435T, could be related to methotrexate toxicity. This prospective study examined the different frequencies of MTHFR, RFC1, and ABCB1 pharmacogenetic variations between patients who have RA and those without RA. We also sought to assess the association between these polymorphisms and MTX toxicity. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped: C677T and A1298C from MTHFR, G80A from RFC1, and C3435T from ABCB1. The efficacy and toxicity of MTX were evaluated through clinical follow-up during 1 year of treatment. RA patients showed a higher frequency of the T allele at MTHFR C677T than patients without RA (p=0.049). There was a significant association between the presence of both the T allele at MTHFR C677T (p=0.006), and the C allele at ABCB1 C3435T (p=0.046), with toxicity development after 12 months of MTX treatment. However, there was no correlation between MTX toxicity and either the A allele at MTHFR A1298C or the G allele at RFC1 A80G. These data suggest that the presence of the MTHFR C677T and ABCB1 C3435T SNPs contribute to MTX toxicity in patients with RA. These observations contribute to a rapidly-growing knowledge base on the pharmacogenetics of RA and personalized medicine.
Rosmarinus officinalis (R. officinalis), a culinary aromatic and medicinal plant, is very rich in polyphenols and flavonoids with high antioxidant properties. This plant was reported to exert multiple benefits for neuronal system and alleviate mood disorder. In our previous study, we demonstrated that R. officinalis and its active compounds, luteolin (Lut), carnosic acid (CA), and rosmarinic acid (RA), exhibited neurotrophic effects and improved cholinergic functions in PC12 cells in correlation with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The current study was conducted to evaluate and understand the anti-depressant effect of R. officinalis using tail suspension test (TST) in ICR mice and PC12 cells as in vitro neuronal model. Proteomics analysis of PC12 cells treated with R. officinalis polyphenols (ROP) Lut, CA, and RA revealed a significant upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) two major genes involved in dopaminergic, serotonergic and GABAergic pathway regulations. Moreover, ROP were demonstrated to protect neuronal cells against corticosterone-induced toxicity. These results were concordant with decreasing immobility time in TST and regulation of several neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) and gene expression in mice brain like TH, PC and MAPK phosphatase (MKP-1). To the best of our knowledge this is the first evidence to contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanism behind the anti-depressant effect of R. officinalis and its major active compounds.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the synovium resulting in the destruction of affected joint cartilage and bone structures. Etanercept is a biological agent that blocks the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated inflammatory processes in RA patients, and has a regenerative effect on cartilage. In order to identify novel disease-related proteins and candidate biomarkers, we performed proteomic profiling of the serum in patients with RA who were treated with etanercept.
Serum samples were obtained from eight RA patients before and after etanercept treatment. The low molecular weight proteins in the serum were concentrated and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results before and after etanercept treatment were compared by the spectrum count method.
Among a total of 477 proteins identified, 12 were found to be decreased and five were increased by etanercept treatment. Some of the changed proteins were known to be related to RA, and most of the other changed proteins may play possible roles in the TNF-α signaling pathway or the state of cartilage and extracellular matrix.
The present proteomic study identified several proteins that could be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. These findings could thus lead to the identification of novel candidate disease-related protein biomarkers for RA, or indicate new targets for therapy.
Most cases of congenital spinal deformities were sporadic and without strong evidence of heritability. The etiology of congenital spinal deformities is still elusive and assumed to be multi-factorial. The current study seeks to elucidate the effect of maternal vitamin A deficiency and the production of congenital spinal deformities in the offsping. Thirty two female rats were randomized into two groups: control group, which was fed a normal diet; vitamin A deficient group, which were given vitamin A-deficient diet from at least 2 weeks before mating till delivery. Three random neonatal rats from each group were killed the next day of parturition. Female rats were fed an AIN-93G diet sufficient in vitamin A to feed the rest of neonates for two weeks until euthanasia. Serum levels of vitamin A were assessed in the adult and filial rats. Anteroposterior (AP) spine radiographs were obtained at week 2 after delivery to evaluate the presence of the skeletal abnormalities especially of spinal deformities. Liver and vertebral body expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDHs) and RARs mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-real time PCR. VAD neonates displayed many skeletal malformations in the cervical, thoracic, the pelvic and sacral and limbs regions. The incidence of congenital scoliosis was 13.79% (8/58) in the filial rats of vitamin A deficiency group and 0% in the control group. Furthermore, vitamin A deficiency negatively regulate the liver and verterbral body mRNA levels of RALDH1, RALDH2, RALDH3, RAR-α, RAR-β and RAR-γ. Vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy may induce congenital spinal deformities in the postnatal rats. The decreases of RALDHs and RARs mRNA expression induced by vitamin A deprivation suggest that vertebral birth defects may be caused by a defect in RA signaling pathway during somitogenesis.
All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), the major active metabolite of vitamin A, plays a role in many biological processes, including maintenance of epithelia, immunity, and fertility and regulation of apoptosis and cell differentiation. atRA is metabolized mainly by CYP26A1, but other P450 enzymes such as CYP2C8 and CYP3As also contribute to atRA 4-hydroxylation. Although the primary metabolite of atRA, 4-OH-RA, possesses a chiral center, the stereochemical course of atRA 4-hydroxylation has not been studied previously. (4S)- and (4R)-OH-RA enantiomers were synthesized and separated by chiral column HPLC. CYP26A1 was found to form predominantly (4S)-OH-RA. This stereoselectivity was rationalized via docking of atRA in the active site of a CYP26A1 homology model. The docked structure showed a well defined niche for atRA within the active site and a specific orientation of the β-ionone ring above the plane of the heme consistent with stereoselective abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the pro-(S)-position. In contrast to CYP26A1, CYP3A4 formed the 4-OH-RA enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio and CYP3A5 preferentially formed (4R)-OH-RA. Interestingly, CYP3A7 and CYP2C8 preferentially formed (4S)-OH-RA from atRA. Both (4S)- and (4R)-OH-RA were substrates of CYP26A1 but (4S)-OH-RA was cleared 3-fold faster than (4R)-OH-RA. In addition, 4-oxo-RA was formed from (4R)-OH-RA but not from (4S)-OH-RA by CYP26A1. Overall, these findings show that (4S)-OH-RA is preferred over (4R)-OH-RA by the enzymes regulating atRA homeostasis. The stereoselectivity observed in CYP26A1 function will aid in better understanding of the active site features of the enzyme and the disposition of biologically active retinoids.
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. The liver is primary organ involved the oxidative catabolism of tryptophan. However, in the immune system, tryptophan and its catabolites, kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), play an anti-inflammatory role. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease. Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) is an animal model of RA. Therefore, it was of interest to measure concentration of tryptophan, kynurenine and 3-HAA in mice with CIA. Concentration of tryptophan and 3-HAA was measured with HPLC methods. Concentration of kynurenine was measured with colorimetric test. mRNA expression for the kynurenine pathway genes was assessed using qRT-PCR. It has been found that in sera from diseased mice concentration of tryptophan was not changed. Concentration of kynurenine and 3-HAA was decreased. Moreover, in the livers from mice with CIA, concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine was decreased. These observations coincided with decreased mRNA expression for Ido2 and Afm and increased mRNA expression for Kynureninase in the liver. It has been also shown that in CIA the concentration of 3-HAA was increased in the kidneys.
We describe the development and characterization of a new cell line, designated Xl1, derived from vertebra and long bones of Xenopus laevis. These cells can mineralize their extracellular matrix upon addition of an inorganic phosphate donor and vitamin C, as characterized by von Kossa staining. In addition they express genes such as matrix gla protein (mgp), alkaline phosphatase, type II collagen, and retinoic acid receptors, representing a valuable tool to analyze expression and regulation of Xenopus cartilage-associated genes. Continuous treatment with retinoic acid (RA) inhibited mineralization, alkaline phosphatase expression and its activity, suggesting that RA is a potential negative regulator of Xl1 cell differentiation. These cells are receptive to efficient transfer of DNA using conventional methods including calcium phosphate, liposome-mediated transfer or electroporation and were found to express basal levels of mgp at least 50-fold higher than the routinely used Xenopus A6 cell line, as seen by transcription assays with the distal X. laevis mgp promoter. Being the first amphibian cell line derived from bone tissue, the Xl1 culture provides an excellent in vitro tool for functional promoter studies, being suitable, among other uses, for identifying promoter elements mediating cartilage-expressed genes as shown here for mgp.
Vitamin A (retinol) and its active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), serve dual roles in the female reproductive tract. Cytochrome P450 26A1 (Cyp26a1), an RA-metabolizing enzyme, is involved in mammalian early pregnancy. In order to investigate the role of RA synthesis and metabolism during embryo implantation, we first investigated the spatiotemporal expression of RA-signal in the mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period. RA-signal-related molecules, including binding proteins, synthesizing enzymes, catabolizing enzymes and receptors, were all expressed in the mouse uterus during embryo implantation. The locations of the RA synthetic system (Aldh1a1, Aldh1a2, CRBP1) and catabolizing enzyme (Cyp26a1) were distinctive in the mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period. Aldh1a1 was located in the gland epithelium, whereas Aldh1a2 and CRBP1 were located in the stroma and Cyp26a1 was expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelium. These results demonstrate that RA synthesis occurs in the stroma, whereas RA metabolism takes place in the endometrial epithelium. When endometrial epithelial cells were isolated on day 4.5 of pregnancy and treated with E(2) (17beta-estradiol) or a combination of E(2) and progesterone, all-trans-RA (10 μM) significantly down-regulated the expression of LIF, HB-EF and CSF-1 in these cells in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that the accumulation of RA in the stroma during mouse embryo implantation has an inhibitory effect on the expression of the three implantation-essential genes, LIF, HB-EGF and CSF-1. Therefore, the expression of Cyp26a1 in luminal and glandular epithelium might block the adverse effect of RA in order to promote successful embryo implantation.
In the present study, the CA III and IV autoantibodies, CA activity, antioxidant enzymes and cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes, hypertensive renal disease, and heart failure were investigated. The anti-CA III antibody titers in patients with RA, SLE, and type 1 diabetes (T1D) were significantly higher than that in control groups (P &lt; 0.05). The anti-CA IV antibody titers in patients with RA, SLE, type 1 diabetic nephropathy (T1DN), and heart failure were significantly higher than that in control groups (P &lt; 0.05) while anti-CA IV antibody could suppress the total CA activity. The SOD and GPx levels in patients with RA, SLE, and T1DN were significantly lower than that in control groups (P &lt; 0.05). IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α levels were significantly higher in SLE group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Weak but significant correlations were found between anti-CA III antibodies and ESR in RA (r = 0.403, P = 0.013) and SLE patients (r = 0.397, P = 0.007). These results suggested that the generation of CA III and IV autoantibodies, antioxidant enzymes, and cytokines might influence each other and CA autoantibodies might affect the normal physiology function of CA.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a biologically active derivative of vitamin A. Previous studies have demonstrated that RA has protective effects against damage caused by H2O2 or oxygen-glucose deprivation in mesangial and PC12 cells. Pretreatment with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) reduced infarction and TUNEL labeling in cerebral cortex as well as attenuated neurological deficits after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine a protective role of 9cRA in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a typical rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD).
The protective role of 9cRA was first examined in rat primary ventromesencephalic culture. Treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated cell death and TUNEL labeling in cultured dopaminergic neurons. The protective effect was also examined in adult male rats. Animals received unilateral 6-OHDA lesioning at the left medial forebrain bundle on day 0. Methamphetamine -induced rotational behavior was examined on days 6, 20 and 30 after lesioning. Animals were separated into 2 groups to balance rotational behavior and lesion extent on day 6 and were treated with either 9cRA or vehicle (i.c.v. on day 7 + intra-nasal from day 8 to day 14). Post-treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced methamphetamine -mediated ipislateral rotation at 20 and 30 days after lesioning. In vivo voltammetry was used to examine DA overflow in striatum. Treatment with 9cRA significantly increased KCl -evoked DA release in the lesioned striatum. 9cRA also increased tyrosine hydroxylase (+) cell number in the lesioned nigra as determined by unbiased stereology.
Our data suggests that early post-treatment with 9cRA has a protective effect against neurodegeneration in nigrostriatal DA neurons in an animal model of PD.
Radix Astragali (root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, RA), Radix Angelicae sinensis (root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, RAS) and Folium Epimedii (leaves of Epimedium brevicomum Maxim., FE) are three of the extensively applied herbal remedies among traditional Chinese medicines for gynecological disorders and osteoporosis. A derivative herbal recipe-RRF, composed of the three medicines with a weight ratio of 5:1:5, is derived from a famous Chinese herbal formula-Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT). RRF has shown noteworthy protective effect in ovariectomized rats, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of perimenopausal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the herbal recipe RRF for its efficacy on perimenopausal disorders and the underlying mechanisms via ovariectomy (OVX) models.
An experimental model of OVX female rats was applied. Vehicle (Sham and OVX group), RRF (564, 282 and 141 mg/kg/d) and conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.1mg/kg/d, reference drug) were all administrated orally once daily for 16 weeks post operation. After the treatment, radioimmunoassay for estradiol (E(2)), lutenizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and β-endorphin (β--EP), neurotransmitter determination by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) for norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), bone mineral density (BMD) assay as well as lipid peroxidation assessment, were carried out to probe into the effectiveness of RRF.
(1) RRF treatment enhanced E(2) synthese while diminished the elevated serum FSH and LH levels; in terms of neurotransmitter, β-EP syntheses rallied whereas the hypothalamic NE, DA and 5-HT release experienced varying mitigation in OVX female rats. (2) Repeated administration of RRF was able to attenuate osteoporosis by elevating the BMD levels of total body, and arrest the bone trabeculae degradation. (3) RRF exposure decreased serum levels of constituent MDA and increased endogenous SOD activity.
Results of the current studies revealed that RRF was capable of acting at multiple targets which presumably underlay its potential protective effect in OVX rats mimicking symptoms as observed in perimenopausal women. Hence, RRF might represent a promising candidate in the treatment of perimenopausal disorders in midlife women.
Smoking increases the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and affects the severity of established RA. Smoking can impact on Th17 lymphocyte differentiation and function through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a process with implications for the pathogenic mechanisms in RA that involve the cytokine, interleukin (IL)-17A. The objective of this study was to establish any effect of smoking on the inflammatory tissue lesions of rheumatoid arthritis via the AHR and IL-17A.
Twenty synovial and eighteen subcutaneous nodule tissue samples from 31 patients with RA were studied. Patient smoking status at the time of tissue collection was established. Expression of AHR, CYP1A1, AHRR, IL6, IL17A, IL17F, IL22, IL23, IL23R, IFNG, TBX21, IDO1 and FOXP3 genes were assessed in tissues and cultured cells using real-time PCR. Two-colour immunofluorescence was used to co-localise AHR and CYP1A1 protein in synovial tissues. The response of monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) to the AHR agonist, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was compared in vitro.
AHR gene expression was demonstrated in rheumatoid synovial tissues and nodules with significantly greater expression in synovia. Expression was not influenced by smoking in either tissue. Evidence of AHR activation, indicated by CYP1A1 and AHRR gene expression, was found only in synovia from patients who smoked. However, IL17A gene expression was lower in synovia from smokers. TBX21 and FOXP3 expression was not affected by smoking. Within the synovial tissues of smokers the principal cell type with evidence of AHR activation was a subset of synovial DCs. This observation was consistent with the sensitivity of human mo-DCs to BaP stimulation demonstrated in vitro. Exposure to BaP affected mo-DC function as demonstrated by decreased IL6 expression induced by PolyI:C, without affecting indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO)1 expression.
Our findings show that one effect of smoking on inflamed rheumatoid synovial tissue involves activation of the AHR pathway. A subset of synovial DCs is important in the response to cigarette smoke. The potential for smoking to affect DC behaviour in joint tissues has relevance to both early and late phases of RA pathogenesis and warrants further investigation.
The roles of vitamin A (VA) in the development of metabolic diseases remain unanswered. We have reported that retinoids synergized with insulin to induce the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c gene (Srebp-1c) expression in primary rat hepatocytes. Additionally, the hepatic Srebp-1c expression is elevated in Zucker fatty (ZF) rats, and reduced in those fed a VA deficient diet. VA is metabolized to retinoic acid (RA) for regulating gene expression. We hypothesized that the expression of RA production enzymes contributes to the regulation of the hepatic Srebp-1c expression. Therefore, we analyzed their expression levels in Zucker lean (ZL) and ZF rats. The mRNA levels of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 gene (Raldh1) were found to be higher in the isolated and cultured primary hepatocytes from ZF rats than that from ZL rats. The RALDH1 protein level was elevated in the liver of ZF rats. Retinol and retinal dose- and time-dependently induced the expression of RA responsive Cyp26a1 gene in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. INS-1 cells were identified as an ideal tool to study the effects of RA production on the regulation of gene expression because only RA, but not retinal, induced Srebp-1c mRNA expression in them. Recombinant adenovirus containing rat Raldh1 cDNA was made and used to infect INS-1 cells. The over-expression of RALDH1 introduced the retinal-mediated induction of Srebp-1c expression in INS-1 cells. We conclude that the expression levels of the enzymes for RA production may contribute to the regulation of RA responsive genes, and determine the responses of the cells to retinoid treatments. The elevated hepatic expression of Raldh1 in ZF rats may cause the excessive RA production from retinol, and in turn, result in higher Srebp-1c expression. This excessive RA production may be one of the factors contributing to the elevated lipogenesis in the liver of ZF rats.
Five SNPs in the human DNase II gene have been reported to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genotype and haplotype analysis of 14 SNPs, nine SNPs of which reported in the NCBI dbSNP database in addition to these five SNPs, was performed in healthy subjects. The enzymatic activities of the amino acid substituted DNase II corresponding to each SNP and serum DNase II in healthy Japanese, and promoter activities derived from each haplotype of the RA-related SNPs were measured. Significant correlations between genotype in each RA-related SNP and enzymatic activity levels were found; alleles associated with RA exhibited a reduction in serum DNase II activity. Furthermore, the promoter activities of each reporter construct corresponding to predominant haplotypes in three SNPs in the promoter region of the gene exhibited significant correlation with levels of serum DNase II activity. These findings indicate these three SNPs could alter the promoter activity of DNASE2, leading to a decline in DNase II activity in the serum through gene expression. Since the three SNPs in the promoter region of the DNase II gene could affect in vivo DNase II activity through reduction of the promoter activity, it is feasible to identify these SNPs susceptible to RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a positive regulator of P19 cell differentiation. Silencing of pre-B cell leukemia transcription factors (PBXs) expression in P19 cells (AS cells) results in a failure of these cells to differentiate to endodermal cells upon RA treatment. Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter Transcription Factor I (COUP-TFI) is an orphan member of the steroid-thyroid hormone superfamily. RA treatment of wild type P19 cells results in a dramatic increase in the expression of COUP-TFI; however, COUP-TFI mRNA levels fail to be elevated upon RA treatment of AS cells indicating that PBX expression is required for elevation in COUP-TFI expression. To study the role of COUP-TFI during RA-dependent differentiation of P19 cells, AS cells that inducibly express various levels of COUP-TFI were prepared. Exogenous expression of COUP-TFI in AS cells, in a dose-dependent fashion, leads to growth inhibition, modest cell cycle disruption, and early apoptosis. Furthermore, AS cells can overcome the blockage in RA-dependent differentiation to endodermal cells when either pharmacological levels of COUP-TFI are expressed or a combination of both the expression of physiological levels of COUP-TFI and RA treatment. Additionally, the mRNA level of several pluripotency associated genes including OCT-4, DAX-1, and SF-1 in the COUP-TFI expressing AS cells are reduced. Moreover, analysis of the expression of primary RA response genes indicates that COUP-TFI is involved in the regulatory modulation of the expression of at least two genes, CYP26A1 and HoxA1. These studies demonstrate that COUP-TFI functions as a physiologically relevant regulator during RA-mediated endodermal differentiation of P19 cells.
Retinoic acid (RA) plays essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis. However, vertebrates cannot synthesize RA de novo. They synthesize it by two oxidative steps, first converting the precursor vitamin A into retinal by retinol dehydrogenase, and then oxidizing retinal into RA irreversibly by retinal dehydrogenase. It is known that vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causes Vitamin A Deficiency Syndrome in animals including quail, mouse, rat, and human. However, little is known about the effects of VAD on zebrafish embryogenesis. In this study, we obtained zebrafish VAD embryos from the zebrafish fed a retinoids-free diet. By analyzing the VAD embryos, we found that VAD caused asymmetric somitogenesis and abnormal hindbrain patterning in zebrafish embryos. However, the phenotype of defected hindbrain in VAD embryos was not as severe as that in the embryos in which aldh1a2, the major gene that is responsible for RA synthesis in zebrafish early development, was knocked down, or the embryos treated with 10 mmol/L DEAB (diethylaminobenzaldehyde, inhibitor of retinal dehydrogenases). Our results indicated that the VAD embryos were short of but not free of vitamin A, and they might also have a RA generation pathway independent of retinal dehydrogenase.
Direct evidence for a role of endogenous retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of vitamin A in the initial differentiation and meiotic entry of spermatogonia, and thus in the initiation of spermatogenesis is still lacking. RA is synthesized by dedicated enzymes, the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH), and binds to and activates nuclear RA receptors (RARA, RARB, and RARG) either within the RA-synthesizing cells or in the neighboring cells. In the present study, we have used a combination of somatic genetic ablations and pharmacological approaches in vivo to show that during the first, prepubertal, spermatogenic cycle (i) RALDH-dependent synthesis of RA by Sertoli cells (SC), the supporting cells of the germ cell (GC) lineage, is indispensable to initiate differentiation of A aligned into A1 spermatogonia; (ii) RARA in SC mediates the effects of RA, possibly through activating Mafb expression, a gene whose Drosophila homolog is mandatory to GC differentiation; (iii) RA synthesized by premeiotic spermatocytes cell autonomously induces meiotic initiation through controlling the RAR-dependent expression of Stra8. Furthermore, we show that RA of SC origin is no longer necessary for the subsequent spermatogenic cycles but essential to spermiation. Altogether, our data establish that the effects of RA in vivo on spermatogonia differentiation are indirect, via SC, but direct on meiotic initiation in spermatocytes, supporting thereby the notion that, contrary to the situation in the female, RA is necessary to induce meiosis in the male.
Retinoic acid (RA) is essential during embryogenesis and for tissue homeostasis, whereas excess RA is well known as a teratogen. In humans, excess RA is associated with hair loss. In the present study, we demonstrate that specific levels of RA, regulated by Cyp26b1, one of the RA-degrading enzymes, are required for hair follicle (hf) morphogenesis. Mice with embryonic ablation of Cyp26b1 (Cyp26b1(-/-)) have excessive endogenous RA, resulting in arrest of hf growth at the hair germ stage. The altered hf development is rescued by grafting the mutant skin on immunodeficient mice. Our results show that normalization of RA levels is associated with reinitiation of hf development. Conditional deficiency of Cyp26b1 in the dermis (En1Cre;Cyp26b1f/-) results in decreased hair follicle density and specific effect on hair type, indicating that RA levels also influence regulators of hair bending. Our results support the model of RA-dependent dermal signals regulating hf downgrowth and bending. To elucidate target gene pathways of RA, we performed microarray and RNA-Seq profiling of genes differentially expressed in Cyp26b1(-/-) skin and En1Cre;Cyp26b1f/- tissues. We show specific effects on the Wnt-catenin pathway and on members of the Runx, Fox, and Sox transcription factor families, indicating that RA modulates pathways and factors implicated in hf downgrowth and bending. Our results establish that proper RA distribution is essential for morphogenesis, development, and differentiation of hfs.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease where oxidative stress has been proposed to contribute to the joint tissue damage. To establish whether measurement of the redox status in blood mirrors the oxidant status at sites of inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we concomitantly examined their oxidant status by spectrophotometry and/or flow cytometry. The basal levels of total reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were significantly raised in neutrophils sourced from peripheral blood and synovial infiltrate, as also showed a strong positive correlation; however, there was no major increase in the reactive nitrogen species RNS generated in monocytes from both sources. Furthermore, raised levels of superoxide in neutrophils of synovial infiltrate showed a positive correlation with NADPH oxidase activity in synovial fluid. Additionally, as ROS generated in both peripheral blood and synovial infiltrate correlated positively with both DAS 28 and CRP/anti-CCP levels, its measurement can serve as an indirect measure of the degree of inflammation in patients with RA.
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in neurogenesis as a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. NO is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by nitric oxide synthases (NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3), which are encoded by separate genes and display different tissue distributions. We used an in vitro model of RA-induced neural differentiation of NT2 cells to examine which of the three NO-synthesizing enzymes is involved in this process. The results revealed a transient induction of NOS3 (known as the constitutively expressed endothelial nitric oxide synthase; eNOS) during the time course of the RA treatment. The peak of gene expression and the nuclear presence of NOS3 protein coincided with cell cycle exit of NT2-derived neuronal precursors. The subsequent analysis of cytosine methylation and histone H3 acetylation of the human NOS3 5' regulatory sequences indicated that epigenetic modifications, especially upstream of the proximal promoter (-734 to -989, relative to exon 2 TSS at +1), were also taking place. NOS1 was expressed only in the differentiated neurons (NT2-N), whereas NOS2 was not expressed at all in this cellular model. Thus, a burst of NO production, possibly required to inhibit neural cell proliferation, was generated by the transient expression of NOS3. This pattern of gene expression, in turn, required epigenetic remodeling of its regulatory region.
We studied the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the radial artery (RA) in 30 patients with DM and 30 non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with autologous RA. RAs were recorded as normal if there was no cellular or stromal tissue between the endothelium and the internal elastic lamina. The RA was normal in 26.7% of diabetic and 76.7% of non-diabetic patients (p = 0.000298). Intimal thickness index and intima:media ratio were higher in the former than in the latter (p &lt; 0.05; p &lt; 0.05), with no significant difference in luminal narrowing (p &gt; 0.05). Electron microscopy scores were lower in the non-diabetic group (p &lt; 0.001); endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and optical density were higher (p &lt; 0.001). Von Willebrand factor and endothelin-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were higher in the DM patients (p &lt; 0.001). The quality of the RA in patients with DM was thus inferior to that in non-diabetic patients. Care should be taken when selecting RA as a conduit in patients with DM.
In previous studies, we investigated the effects of excess retinoic acid (RA) during palatogenesis by RA administration to pregnant mice. In the present study, we deleted Cyp26b1, one of the RA-degrading enzymes, to further study the effects of excess RA in the normal developing palate and to understand how endogenous levels of RA are regulated.
Excess RA, due to the absence of Cyp26b1, targets cells in the bend region of the palatal shelves and inhibits their horizontal elevation, leading to cleft palate. An organ culture of Cyp26b1-/- palatal shelves after tongue removal did not rescue the impaired elevation of the palatal shelves. The expression of Fgf10, Bmp2, and Tbx1, important molecules in palatal development, was down-regulated. Cell proliferation was decreased in the bend region of palatal shelves. Tongue muscles were hypoplastic and/or missing in Cyp26b1-/- mice.
We demonstrated that CYP26B1 is essential during palatogenesis. Excess RA due to the lack of Cyp26b1 suppresses the expression of key regulators of palate development in the bend region, resulting in a failure in the horizontal elevation of the palatal shelves. The regulation of RA signaling through CYP26B1 is also necessary for the development of tongue musculature and for tongue depression.
Vitamin A (VA) plays an important role in post-natal lung development and maturation. Previously, we have reported that a supplemental dose of VA combined with 10% of all-trans-retinoic acid (VARA) synergistically increases retinol uptake and retinyl ester (RE) storage in neonatal rat lung, while up-regulating several retinoid homeostatic genes including lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and the retinol-binding protein receptor, stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6). However, whether inflammation has an impact on the expression of these genes and thus compromises the ability of VARA to increase lung RE content is not clear. Neonatal rats, 7- to 8-d-old, were treated with VARA either concurrently with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Expt 1) or 12 h after LPS administration (Expt 2); in both studies, lung tissue was collected 6 h after VARA treatment, when RE formation is maximal. Inflammation was confirmed by increased IL-6 and chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression in lung at 6 h and C-reactive protein in plasma at 18 h. In both studies, LPS-induced inflammation only slightly reduced, but did not prevent the VARA-induced increase in lung RE. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that co-administration of LPS with VARA slightly attenuated the VARA-induced increase of LRAT mRNA, but not of STRA6 or cytochrome P450 26B1, the predominant RA hydroxylase in lung. By 18 h post-LPS, expression had subsided and none of these genes differed from the level in the control group. Overall, the present results suggest that retinoid homeostatic gene expression is reduced modestly, if at all, by acute LPS-induced inflammation and that VARA is still effective in increasing lung RE under conditions of moderate inflammation.
Zebrafish lost anterior teeth during evolution but retain a posterior pharyngeal dentition that requires retinoic acid (RA) cell-cell signaling for its development. The purposes of this study were to test the sufficiency of RA to induce tooth development and to assess its role in evolution. We found that exposure of embryos to exogenous RA induces a dramatic anterior expansion of the number of pharyngeal teeth that later form and shifts anteriorly the expression patterns of genes normally expressed in the posterior tooth-forming region, such as pitx2 and dlx2b. After RA exposure, we also observed a correlation between cartilage malformations and ectopic tooth induction, as well as abnormal cranial neural crest marker gene expression. Additionally, we observed that the RA-induced zebrafish anterior teeth resemble in pattern and number the dentition of fish species that retain anterior pharyngeal teeth such as medaka but that medaka do not express the aldh1a2 RA-synthesizing enzyme in tooth-forming regions. We conclude that RA is sufficient to induce anterior ectopic tooth development in zebrafish where teeth were lost in evolution, potentially by altering neural crest cell development, and that changes in the location of RA synthesis correlate with evolutionary changes in vertebrate dentitions.
Mechanisms for sex- and depot-specific fat formation are unclear. We investigated the role of retinoic acid (RA) production by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1, -a2, and -a3), the major RA-producing enzymes, on sex-specific fat depot formation. Female Aldh1a1(-/-) mice, but not males, were resistant to high-fat (HF) diet-induced visceral adipose formation, whereas subcutaneous fat was reduced similarly in both groups. Sexual dimorphism in visceral fat (VF) was attributable to elevated adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) protein expression localized in clusters of multilocular uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-positive cells in female Aldh1a1(-/-) mice compared with males. Estrogen decreased Aldh1a3 expression, limiting conversion of retinaldehyde (Rald) to RA. Rald effectively induced Atgl levels via nongenomic mechanisms, demonstrating indirect regulation by estrogen. Experiments in transgenic mice expressing an RA receptor response element (RARE-lacZ) revealed HF diet-induced RARE activation in VF of females but not males. In humans, stromal cells isolated from VF of obese subjects also expressed higher levels of Aldh1 enzymes compared with lean subjects. Our data suggest that an HF diet mediates VF formation through a sex-specific autocrine Aldh1 switch, in which Rald-mediated lipolysis in Ucp1-positive visceral adipocytes is replaced by RA-mediated lipid accumulation. Our data suggest that Aldh1 is a potential target for sex-specific antiobesity therapy.
Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH) catalyze the synthesis of the regulatory factor retinoic acid (RA). Cultured astrocytes express several of the RALDH enzyme family, and it has been assumed that this can be extrapolated to astrocytes in vivo. However, this study finds that few astrocytes in the rodent brain express detectable RALDH enzymes, and only when these cells are grown in culture are these enzymes upregulated. Factors controlling the expression of the RALDHs in cultured astrocytes were explored to determine possible reasons for differences between in vitro versus in vivo expression. Retinoids were found to feedback to suppress several of the RALDHs, and physiological levels of retinoids may be one route by which astrocytic RALDHs are maintained at low levels. In the case of RALDH2, in vivo reduction of vitamin A levels in rats resulted in an increase in astrocyte RALDH2 expression in the hippocampus. Other factors though are likely to control RALDH expression. A shift in astrocytic RALDH subcellular localization is a potential mechanism for regulating RA signaling. Under conditions of vitamin A deficiency, RALDH2 protein moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it may synthesize RA at the site of the nuclear RA receptors. Similarly, in conditions of oxidative stress RALDH1 and RALDH2 moved from the cytoplasm to a predominantly nuclear position. Thus, the RALDHs have been revealed to be dynamic in their expression in astrocytes where they may maintain retinoid homeostasis in the brain.
Although the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) plays a critical role in immune function, RA synthesis during infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that retinal dehydrogenases (Raldh), required for the synthesis of RA, are induced during a retinoid-dependent type-2 immune response elicited by Schistosoma mansoni infection, but not during a retinoid-independent anti-viral immune response. Vitamin A deficient mice have a selective defect in T(H)2 responses to S. mansoni, but retained normal LCMV specific T(H)1 responses. A combination of in situ imaging, intra-vital imaging, and sort purification revealed that alternatively activated macrophages (AAMφ) express high levels of Raldh2 during S. mansoni infection. IL-4 induces Raldh2 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro and peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Finally, in vivo derived AAMφ have an enhanced capacity to induce Foxp3 expression in CD4+ cells through an RA dependent mechanism, especially in combination with TGF-β. The regulation of Raldh enzymes during infection is pathogen specific and reflects differential requirements for RA during effector responses. Specifically, AAMφ are an inducible source of RA synthesis during helminth infections and T(H)2 responses that may be important in regulating immune responses.
This study provides a desirable candidate gene resource (SmAOC) to increase the content of valuable natural products via appropriate JA pathway genetic engineering. Jasmonates (JAs) are important signal molecules in plants. They regulate transcripts of defense and secondary biosynthetic metabolite genes in response to environmental stresses. Currently, JAs are widely used as elicitors to improve the content of useful secondary metabolism in plants. Synthesis of the naturally occurring enantiomer of various jasmonates is catalyzed by allene oxide cyclase (AOC, EC 5.3.99.6). Here, we cloned and characterized the AOC gene (SmAOC) from Salvia miltiorrhiza. As expected, SmAOC expression was induced by abiotic stimuli such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ultraviolet radiation (UV) and low temperature (4 °C) in S. miltiorrhiza plantlets. To demonstrate whether the engineered internal JAs pool by overexpressing AOC gene could promote secondary metabolism production, the SmAOC was incorporated into S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. The results revealed that SmAOC overexpression significant enhanced the yields of tanshinone IIA, rosmarinic acid (RA) and lithospermic acid B (LAB) in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. In addition, expression levels for key genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of diterpenes and phenolic acids were also altered. These suggest that genetic manipulation of AOC would be helpful for improving the production of valuable secondary metabolites by regulating the biosynthesis of JAs.
Adrenergic hormones are essential for early heart development. To gain insight into understanding how these hormones influence heart development, we evaluated genomic expression changes in embryonic hearts from adrenergic-deficient and wild-type control mice. To perform this study, we used a mouse model with targeted disruption of the Dopamine β-hydroxylase (Dbh) gene, whose product is responsible for enzymatic conversion of dopamine into norepinephrine. Embryos homozygous for the null allele (Dbh(-/-)) die from heart failure beginning as early as embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). To assess underlying causes of heart failure, we isolated hearts from Dbh(-/-) and Dbh(+/+) embryos prior to manifestation of the phenotype and examined gene expression changes using genomic Affymetrix 430A 2.0 arrays, which enabled simultaneous evaluation of &gt;22,000 genes. We found that only 22 expressed genes showed a significant twofold or greater change, representing ~0.1% of the total genes analyzed. More than half of these genes are associated with either metabolism (31%) or signal transduction (22%). Remarkably, several of the altered genes encode for proteins that are directly involved in retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis and transport. Subsequent evaluation showed that RA concentrations were significantly elevated by an average of ~3-fold in adrenergic-deficient (Dbh(-/-)) embryos compared with controls, thereby suggesting that RA may be an important downstream mediator of adrenergic action during embryonic heart development.
Despite extensive efforts, low efficiency is still an issue in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The hypothesis of our study was that the use of cytoplasts produced by chemically assisted enucleation (EN) would improve nuclear reprogramming in nuclear transfer (NT)-derived embryos because it results in lower damage and higher cytoplasm content than conventional EN. For that purpose, we investigated the expression of two X-linked genes: X inactive-specific transcript (XIST) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). In the first experiment, gene expression was assessed in day-7 female blastocysts from embryonic cell NT (ECNT) groups [conventional, ECNT conv; chemically assisted, ECNT deme (demecolcine)]. Whereas in the ECNT conv group, only one embryo (25%; n=4) expressed XIST transcripts, most embryos showed XIST expression (75%; n=4) in the ECNT deme group. However, no significant differences in transcript abundance of XIST and G6PD were found when comparing the embryos from all groups. In a second experiment using somatic cells as nuclear donors, we evaluated gene expression profiles in female SCNT-derived embryos. No significant differences in relative abundance (RA) of XIST transcripts were observed among the groups. Nonetheless, higher (p&lt;0.05) levels of G6PD were observed in SCNT deme and in vitro-derived groups in comparison to SCNT conv. To know whether higher G6PD expression in embryos derived from SCNT chemically assisted EN indicates higher metabolism in embryos considered of superior quality or if the presence of higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels generated by the increased oxygen consumption triggers G6PD activation, the expression of genes related to stress response should be investigated in embryos produced by that technique.
Although the concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is well-accepted for many tumors, the existence of such cells in human melanoma has been the subject of debate. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of human melanoma cells that fulfill the criteria for CSCs (self-renewal and differentiation) by serially xenotransplanting cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. These cells possess high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity with ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 being the predominant ALDH isozymes. ALDH-positive melanoma cells are more tumorigenic than ALDH-negative cells in both NOD/SCID mice and NSG mice. Biological analyses of the ALDH-positive melanoma cells reveal the ALDH isozymes to be key molecules regulating the function of these cells. Silencing ALDH1A by siRNA or shRNA leads to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, decreased cell viability in vitro, and reduced tumorigenesis in vivo. ALDH-positive melanoma cells are more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and silencing ALDH1A by siRNA sensitizes melanoma cells to drug-induced cell death. Furthermore, we, for the first time, examined the molecular signatures of ALDH-positive CSCs from patient-derived tumor specimens. The signatures of melanoma CSCs include retinoic acid (RA)-driven target genes with RA response elements and genes associated with stem cell function. These findings implicate that ALDH isozymes are not only biomarkers of CSCs but also attractive therapeutic targets for human melanoma. Further investigation of these isozymes and genes will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CSCs and reveal new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention of cancer.
Meiotic initiation of germ cells at 13.5 dpc (days post-coitus) indicates female sex determination in mice. Recent studies reveal that mesonephroi-derived retinoic acid (RA) is the key signal for induction of meiosis. However, whether the mesonephroi is dispensable for meiosis is unclear and the role of the ovary in this meiotic process remains to be clarified. This study provides data that RA derived from fetal ovaries is sufficient to induce germ cell meiosis in a fetal ovary culture system. When fetal ovaries were collected from 11.5 to 13.5 dpc fetuses, isolated and cultured in vitro, germ cells enter meiosis in the absence of mesonephroi. To exclude RA sourcing from mesonephroi, 11.5 dpc urogenital ridges (UGRs; mesonephroi and ovary complexes) were treated with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) to block retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) activity in the mesonephros and the ovary. Meiosis occurred when DEAB was withdrawn and the mesonephros was removed 2 days later. Furthermore, RALDH1, rather than RALDH2, serves as the major RA synthetase in UGRs from 12.5 to 15.5 dpc. DEAB treatment to the ovary alone was able to block germ cell meiotic entry. We also found that exogenously supplied RA dose-dependently reduced germ cell numbers in ovaries by accelerating the entry into meiosis. These results suggest that ovary-derived RA is responsible for meiosis initiation.
Primitive endoderm formation from the inner cell mass is one of the earliest known cell fate decisions made in the mouse embryo. The mechanisms involved in orchestrating this process are not fully understood and are difficult to study in vivo. The F9 teratocarcinoma cell line is an in vitro model used to circumvent many technical problems surrounding the study of extraembryonic endoderm differentiation. F9 cells treated with retinoic acid differentiate to primitive endoderm and this is accompanied by the activation of canonical Wnt-β-catenin signalling. Reactive oxygen species can modulate this signalling pathway, but whether they are sufficient to induce extraembryonic endoderm in vitro is not known. In the present study, a sustained increase in ROS levels was found in retinoic acid-treated F9 cells. An increase in Tcf-Lef transcriptional activity, a read out of Wnt-β-catenin signalling, was also seen in response to exogenous H(2)O(2). Analysis from immunoblots, immunocytochemistry and real time PCR revealed the presence of markers of differentiation and a reduction in the expression of a marker of proliferation, confirming that H(2)O(2)-treated F9 cells developed into primitive endoderm. In contrast, exposing retinoic acid-treated cells to antioxidants impeded differentiation. Real time PCR was also used to identify candidates responsible for the observed elevation in ROS production. Results indicated that the NADPH oxidase 1, 2, 3 and 4 and Duox2 genes were RA responsive. Furthermore, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride was shown to attenuate primitive endoderm formation. Together, these results shed new light on how early mouse embryogenesis might be influenced by the crosstalk involving ROS and the Wnt-β-catenin signalling pathway.
The treatment of effluents from textile industry with microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi, has recently gained attention. The present study was conducted using white rot fungi Irpex lacteus, Trametes hirsuta, Trametes sp., and Lentinula edodes for the decolorization of reactive textile Levafix Blue E-RA granulate dye. I. lacteus resulted in the best decolorization and degradation of the dye within four days. Therefore, more detailed studies were carried out using I. lacteus. The decolorization was evaluated at various concentration, pH values, and temperatures. The activities of laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase enzymes were estimated to reveal the roles of enzymes in decolorization. The colorless nature of the fungal cells revealed that decolorization occurred through degradation, and confirmed by analysis of the metabolites by UV-visible spectroscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatography after decolorization. The metabolites were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, and functional group analysis was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The degraded dye metabolites were assessed for phytotoxicity using Vigna radiata and Brassica juncea, which demonstrated nontoxic nature of the metabolites formed after degradation of dye.
The performance of a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict nonresponse of methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and failure of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was studied.
For 75 RA patients receiving MTX monotherapy for 6 months, DNA and clinical data were available. Risk scores for nonresponse at 6 months (disease activity score &gt;2.4), were calculated using the pharmacogenetic prediction model utilizing four clinical factors and four polymorphisms in the genes MTHFD1, AMPD1, ITPA and ATIC.
At 6 months, there were 25 responders and 50 nonresponders. Using the clinical pharmacogenetic prediction model, 75% (56 out of 75) were categorized into predicted responders (risk score ≤ 3.5) and predicted nonresponders (risk score ≥ 6). At 6 months, the negative predictive value was 81% (21 out of 26) and the positive predictive value was 47% (14 out of 30).
The pharmacogenetic model predicts nonresponse to MTX monotherapy, but performs better in DMARD naive recent-onset RA patients than in patients with preceding DMARD failure.
To determine whether MPO contributes to oxidative stress and disease activity in RA and whether it produces hypochlorous acid in SF.
Plasma and where possible SF were collected from 77 RA patients while 120 healthy controls supplied plasma only. MPO and protein carbonyls were measured by ELISAs. 3-Chlorotyrosine in proteins and allantoin in plasma were measured by mass spectrometry.
Plasma MPO concentrations were significantly higher in patients with RA compared with healthy controls [10.8 ng/ml, inter-quartile range (IQR): 7.2-14.2; P&lt;0.05], but there was no significant difference in plasma MPO protein concentrations between RA patients with high disease activity (HDA; DAS-28 &gt;3.2) and those with low disease activity (LDA; DAS-28 ≤ 3.2) (HDA 27.9 ng/ml, 20.2-34.1 vs LDA 22.1 ng/ml, 16.9-34.9; P&gt;0.05). There was a significant relationship between plasma MPO and DAS-28 (r=0.35; P=0.005). Plasma protein carbonyls and allantoin were significantly higher in patients with RA compared with the healthy controls. MPO protein was significantly higher in SF compared with plasma (median 624.0 ng/ml, IQR 258.4-2433.0 vs 30.2 ng/ml, IQR 25.1-50.9; P&lt;0.0001). The MPO present in SF was mostly active. 3-Chlorotyrosine, a specific biomarker of hypochlorous acid, was present in proteins from SF and related to the concentration of MPO (r=0.69; P=0.001). Protein carbonyls in SF were associated with MPO protein concentration (r=0.40; P=0.019) and 3-chlorotyrosine (r=0.66; P=0.003).
MPO is elevated in patients with RA and promotes oxidative stress through the production of hypochlorous acid.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic periodontitis (CP) are the most common chronic inflammatory diseases and have remarkable similar pathologies. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of periodontal status on oxidative stress in patients with RA by evaluating serum oxidative parameters and prolidase levels.
For this cross-sectional comparative study, the following four groups were composed of 20 individuals each (80 individuals total): 1) RA with CP (RA-CP group); 2) RA but periodontally healthy (RA-C group); 3) systemically healthy with CP (CP group); and 4) systemically and periodontally healthy (C group). Demographic, periodontal, rheumatological, and serum oxidative parameters as determined by serum total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index (OSI), lipid hydroperoxide levels, paraoxonase, arylesterase, and ceruloplasmin activity, prolidase level, and total sulfhydryl groups were evaluated.
The OSI values of the RA-CP group were statistically significantly higher than those of the C group (P &lt;0.05). The prolidase levels of the RA-C, RA-CP groups and the CP group were statistically higher than those of the C group (P = 0.001, P = 0.007, and P = 0.001, respectively).
Although CP and RA each increase oxidative stress, in a small sample size these effects are only significant when both CP and RA are combined relative to neither exposure. In addition, increased prolidase levels in patients with RA and CP may be related to increased oxidative tissue damage.
Embryonic development of the respiratory system is regulated by a series of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions that are only partially understood. Mesenchymal FGF and Wnt2/Wnt2b signaling are implicated in specification of mammalian pulmonary progenitors from the ventral foregut endoderm, but their epistatic relationship and downstream targets are largely unknown. In addition, how wnt2 and wnt2b are regulated in the developing foregut mesenchyme is unknown. We show that the Odd-skipped-related (Osr) zinc-finger transcriptional repressors Osr1 and Osr2 are redundantly required for Xenopus lung specification in a molecular pathway linking foregut pattering by FGFs to Wnt-mediated lung specification and RA-regulated lung bud growth. FGF and RA signals are required for robust osr1 and osr2 expression in the foregut endoderm and surrounding lateral plate mesoderm (lpm) prior to respiratory specification. Depletion of both Osr1 and Osr2 (Osr1/Osr2) results in agenesis of the lungs, trachea and esophagus. The foregut lpm of Osr1/Osr2-depleted embryos fails to express wnt2, wnt2b and raldh2, and consequently Nkx2.1(+) progenitors are not specified. Our data suggest that Osr1/Osr2 normally repress bmp4 expression in the lpm, and that BMP signaling negatively regulates the wnt2b domain. These results significantly advance our understanding of early lung development and may impact strategies to differentiate respiratory tissue from stem cells.
Both retinoid status and inflammation have been shown to control the level of expression of retinoid homeostatic genes. In the present study, DHRS3, previously shown to possess retinal reductase activity, was identified by microarray analysis of THP-1 monocytes as a possible gene target of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). In these cells, DHRS3 mRNA increased 30- to 40-fold after treatment with ≤20 nM RA for 24 h, while DHRS3 protein also increased. Of several synthetic retinoids tested, only Am580, a RA receptor-α-selective retinoid, increased DHRS3 mRNA expression. The full-length DHRS3 cDNA was cloned from rat liver and subjected to in vitro transcription-translation. Two major ∼30- and 35-kDa proteins were detected. In adult rat tissues, DHRS3 mRNA was most abundant in the adrenal gland, liver, and ovary. In the liver, DHRS3 is expressed in hepatocytes and possibly in all liver cells. To evaluate whether DHRS3 is regulated in the liver by RA and/or inflammatory stimuli, we treated rats for 6 h with RA or LPS or both. DHRS3 mRNA was doubled by RA but reduced by &gt;90% after treatment with LPS in the absence and presence of RA. On the basis of our results, DHRS3 mRNA expression is regulated by RA in a tissue- or cell-type specific manner; the RA-induced increase in DHRS3 may contribute to retinoid storage; and a reduction of DHRS3 expression in the liver during inflammation may contribute to the perturbation of whole body vitamin A metabolism that has previously been shown to occur in conditions of inflammatory stress.
Rational selection of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has many potential advantages, including rapid disease control, reduced long-term disability and reduced overall cost to the healthcare system. Inter-individual genetic differences are particularly attractive as markers to predict efficacy and toxicity, as they can be determined rapidly prior to drug selection. The aims of this study, therefore, were to investigate the association between differences in genes associated with the metabolism, clearance and efficacy of leflunomide with its cessation in a group of rheumatoid arthritis patients who were treated with an intensive contemporary, treat-to-target approach.
This retrospective cohort study identified all individuals who received leflunomide and were enrolled in the Early Arthritis inception cohort at the Royal Adelaide Hospital between 2001 and July 2011. Inclusion criteria were age (&gt;18) and a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were excluded if a DNA sample was not available, if they withdrew from the cohort or if clinical data were insufficient. Subjects were followed for 12 months or until either another disease modifying antirheumatic drug was added or leflunomide was ceased. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined: CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285), CYP2C19*17 (rs12248560), ABCG2 421C&gt;A (rs2231142), CYP1A2*1F (rs762551) and DHODH 19C&gt;A (rs3213422). The effects of variables on cessation were assessed with Cox Proportional Hazard models.
Thirty-three of 78 (42.3%) patients ceased leflunomide due to side effects. A linear trend between cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) phenotype and leflunomide cessation was observed, with poor and intermediate metabolizers ceasing more frequently (adjusted Hazard Ratio = 0.432 for each incremental change in phenotype, 95% CI 0.237 to 0.790, P = 0.006). Previously observed associations between cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) genotype and toxicity were not apparent, but there was a trend for ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) genotype to be associated with cessation due to diarrhea.
CYP2C19 phenotype was associated with cessation due to toxicity, and since CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizers have lower teriflunomide concentrations, it is likely that they have a particularly poor risk:benefit ratio when using this drug.
Meiosis is a process unique to the differentiation of germ cells and exhibits sex-specific in timing. Previous studies showed that retinoic acid (RA) as the vitamin A metabolite is crucial for controlling Stra8 (Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8) expression in the gonad and to initiate meiosis; however, the mechanism by which retinoid-signaling acts has remained unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) which catalyzes RA synthesizes by initiating meiosis in chicken ovarian germ cells. Meiotic germ cells were first detected at day 15.5 in chicken embryo ovary when the expression of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (Scp3) and disrupted meiotic cDNA 1 homologue (Dmc1) became elevated, while Stra8 expression was specifically up-regulated at day 12.5 before meiosis onset. It was observed from the increase in Raldh2 mRNA expression levels and decreases in Cyp26b1 (the enzyme for RA catabolism) expression levels during meiosis that requirement for RA accumulation is essential to sustain meiosis. This was also revealed by RA stimulation of the cultured ovaries with the initiation of meiosis response, and the knocking down of the Raldh2 expression during meiosis, leading to abolishment of RA-dependent action. Altogether, these studies indicate that RA synthesis by the enzyme RALDH2 and signaling through its receptor is crucial for meiosis initiation in chicken embryonic ovary.
Retinoic acid (RA), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, is used medicinally for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases including dermatological conditions and cancer. The antiproliferative effects of RA have been well documented as well as the limitations owing to toxicity and the development of resistance to RA therapy. RA metabolism inhibitors (RAMBAs or CYP26 inhibitors) are attracting increasing interest as an alternative method for enhancing endogenous levels of retinoic acid in the treatment of hyperproliferative disease. Here the synthesis and inhibitory activity of novel 3-(1H-imidazol- and triazol-1-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(4-(phenylamino)phenyl)propyl derivatives in a MCF-7 CYP26A1 microsomal assay are described. The most promising inhibitor methyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(4-(phenylamino)phenyl)-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propanoate (6) exhibited an IC(50) of 13 nM (compared with standards Liarozole IC(50) 540 nM and R116010 IC(50) 10 nM) and was further evaluated for CYP selectivity using a panel of CYP with &gt;100-fold selectivity for CYP26 compared with CYP1A2, 2C9 and 2D6 observed and 15-fold selectivity compared with CYP3A4. The results demonstrate the potential for further development of these potent inhibitors.
Oxidative stress such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the inflamed joint have been indicated as being involved as inflammatory mediators in the induction of arthritis. Correlations between extracellular- superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and inflammatory arthritis have been shown in several animal models of RA. However, there is a question whether the over-expression of EC-SOD on arthritic joint also could suppress the progression of disease or not. In the present study, the effect on the synovial tissue of experimental arthritis was investigated using EC-SOD over-expressing transgenic mice. The over-expression of EC- SOD in joint tissue was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The degree of the inflammation in EC-SOD transgenic mice was suppressed in the collagen-induced arthritis model. In a cytokine assay, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as, IL-1β, TNFα, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was decreased in fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) but not in peripheral blood. Histological examination also showed repressed cartilage destruction and bone in EC-SOD transgenic mice. In conclusion, these data suggest that the over-expression of EC-SOD in FLS contributes to the activation of FLS and protection from joint destruction by depressing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMPs. These results provide EC-SOD transgenic mice with a useful animal model for inflammatory arthritis research.
l-Tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) is an active ingredients of Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang, which protects against acute global cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury. In this study, we show that l-THP is cardioprotective in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and examined the mechanism. Rats were treated with l-THP (0, 10, 20, 40 mg/kg b.w.) for 20 min before occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and subjected to myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (30 min/6 h). Compared with vehicle-treated animals, the infarct area/risk area (IA/RA) of l-THP (20, 40 mg/kg b.w.) treated rats was reduced, whilst l-THP (10 mg/kg b.w.) had no significant effect. Cardiac function was improved in l-THP-treated rats whilst plasma creatine kinase activity declined. Following treatment with l-THP (20 mg/kg b.w.), subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85, serine(473) phosphorylation of Akt and serine(1177) phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) increased in myocardium, whilst expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) decreased. However, the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF were increased in I(30 min)R(6 h), but decreased to normal level in I(30 min)R(24 h), while treatment with l-THP (20 mg/kg b.w.) enhanced the levels of these two genes in I(30 min)R(24 h). Production of NO in myocardium and plasma, activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in plasma and the expression of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in myocardium were decreased by l-THP. TUNEL assay revealed that l-THP (20 mg/kg b.w.) reduced apoptosis in myocardium. Thus, we show that l-THP activates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS/NO pathway and increases expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, whilst depressing iNOS-derived NO production in myocardium. This effect may decrease the accumulation of inflammatory factors, including TNF-α and MPO, and lessen the extent of apoptosis, therefore contributing to the cardioprotective effects of l-THP in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
The objective of the study was to elucidate mRNA expression of CYP26b1 (cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide 1) and signalling molecules ALDH1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1), CRABPII (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II), RARα (retinoic acid receptor alpha) and STRA8 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8) in dog testis from different post-natal developmental ages. Testicular tissue samples were collected from medium-sized mixed breed dogs at different ages such as young (&lt;4 months; N = 4), peripubertal (4-8 months; N = 3) and adult (&gt;8 months; N = 4) were used to evaluate relative mRNA expression. Genes of RA-degrading enzyme CYP26b1, ALDH1 involved in RA synthesis and genes of carrier protein CRABPII involved in RA metabolism were turned on during the post-natal testicular development in dogs. Their expression pattern differs at different developmental ages (p &lt; 0.05), and the levels of mRNA expression were compensated towards a normal developmental response for the sexual maturity and continuous spermatogenesis. The mRNA expression of RARα, one of the RA receptors participates in RA signalling in connection to spermatogenesis, was recorded in young and adult stages at varying degree. STRA8 is one of the responsive genes with regard to meiosis, and this functional gene product was expressed in all ages with the changing level (p &lt; 0.01). In summary, the expression pattern of RA signalling molecules differed from young to adult ages, and it is expected that these changes are to compensate towards a normal developmental response for the sexual maturity and continuous spermatogenesis.
The nuclear receptor ligand retinoic acid (RA) has been identified as an endogenous regulatory factor in the hippocampus, acting on pyramidal neurons and granule neuron progenitors, but almost nothing is known about the distribution of RA itself in the hippocampus. This study describes the source of RA for the rodent hippocampus in the meninges via the key RA synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2). Diffusion of RA from the meninges potentially creates a gradient of RA across the infrapyramidal and suprapyramidal blades of the dentate gyrus, enhanced by the expression of the RA catabolic enzyme Cyp26B1 between the blades, and an infrapyramidal and suprapyramidal blade difference is evident in RA-regulated transcription. This asymmetry may contribute to some of the physiological and molecular differences between the blades, including a disparity in the rates of cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of the two blades through RA inhibition of cell proliferation. Such differences can be altered by either the application of excess RA, its effect dependent on the relative position along the septotemporal axis, or change in RA signaling through mutation of retinol binding protein, while the capacity of RA to inhibit proliferation of cells in the dentate gyrus is demonstrated using in vitro slice culture. Use of synthetic and catabolic enzymes in the hippocampus to create differing zones of RA concentration parallels the mechanisms used in the developing brain to generate patterns of RA-regulated transcription.
Retinoic acid (RA) has been found to regulate hypothalamic function, but precisely where it acts is unknown. This study shows expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes in tanycytes that line the third ventricle in an area overlapping with the site of hypothalamic neural stem cells. The influence of RA was examined on the proliferation of progenitors lining the third ventricle using organotypic slice cultures. As has been shown in other regions of neurogenesis, RA was found to inhibit proliferation. Investigations of the dynamics of RALDH1 expression in the rat hypothalamus have shown that this enzyme is in tanycytes under photoperiodic control with highest levels during long versus short days. In parallel to this shift in RA synthesis, cell proliferation in the third ventricle was found to be lowest during long days when RA was highest, implying that RALDH1 synthesized RA may regulate neural stem cell proliferation. A second RA synthesizing enzyme, RALDH2 was also present in tanycytes lining the third ventricle. In contrast to RALDH1, RALDH2 showed little change with photoperiodicity, but surprisingly the protein was present in the apparent absence of mRNA transcript and it is hypothesized that the endocytic tanycytes may take this enzyme up from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) gene is related to oxidative stress that has been involved in the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in genome-wide pathway analysis and replication studies. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the MSRA gene is implicated in susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) disease in RA patients.
A total of 1302 patients fulfilling the 1987 American College of Rheumatism classification criteria for RA were genotyped for the MSRA rs10903323 (G/A) polymorphism. Two hundred and thirty-three (17.9%) patients experienced CV events. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 genotyping was performed using molecular-based methods. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed with adjustments for gender, age at RA diagnosis, follow-up, rheumatoid shared epitope, and traditional CV risk as potential confounders.
There were no statistically significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies for the MSRA rs10903323 polymorphism between RA patients who experienced CV events and those who did not. However, an adjusted logistic regression model disclosed that the minor allele G yielded a marginally significant increased risk of CV events in this series of patients with RA [p = 0.05, odds ratio (OR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.85]. When the logistic regression model was adjusted for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody status instead of for shared epitope, an increased risk of having ischaemic heart disease was found in patients carrying the minor allele G (p = 0.04, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.88).
The MSRA rs10903323 gene polymorphism may be implicated in the increased risk to develop CV events, in particular ischaemic heart disease, observed in RA patients.
Cavernous nerve injury is the main reason for post-prostatectomy erectile dysfunction (ED). Stem cell and neuroprotection therapy are promising therapeutic strategy for ED.
To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immobilized Poly-Lactic-Co-Glycolic (PLGA) membrane on the cavernous nerve in a rat model of post-prostatectomy ED. Methods.  Rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal group, bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury (BCNI) group, ADSC (BCNI group with ADSCs on cavernous nerve) group, BDNF-membrane (BCNI group with BDNF/PLGA membrane on cavernous nerve) group, and ADSC/BDNF-membrane (BCNI group with ADSCs covered with BDNF/PLGA membrane on cavernous nerve) group. BDNF was controlled-released for a period of 4 weeks in a BDNF/PLGA porous membrane system.
Four weeks after the operation, erectile function was assessed by detecting the ratio of intra-cavernous pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP). Smooth muscle and collagen content were determined by Masson's trichrome staining. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in the dorsal penile nerve was detected by immunostaining. Phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level of the corpus cavernosum were quantified by Western blotting and cGMP assay, respectively.
In the ADSC/BDNF-membrane group, erectile function was significantly elevated, compared with the BCNI and other treated groups. ADSC/BDNF-membrane treatment significantly increased smooth muscle/collagen ratio, nNOS content, phospho-eNOS protein expression, and cGMP level, compared with the BCNI and other treated groups.
ADSCs with BDNF-membrane on the cavernous nerve can improve erectile function in a rat model of post-prostatectomy ED, which may be used as a novel therapy for post-prostatectomy ED.
Fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) invasiveness correlates with articular damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet little is known about its regulation. In this study we aimed to determine the role of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) in FLS invasion. FLS were isolated from synovial tissues obtained from RA patients and from DA rats with pristane-induced arthritis. Invasion was tested on Matrigel-coated chambers in the presence of the LXR agonist T0901317, or control vehicle. FLS were cultured in the presence or absence of T0901317, and supernatants were used to quantify matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-2, MMP-3, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (p65) and Akt activation, actin cytoskeleton, cell morphology and lamellipodia formation were also determined. The LXR agonist T0901317 significantly reduced DA FLS invasion by 99% (P ≤ 0.001), and RA FLS invasion by 96% (P ≤ 0.001), compared with control. T0901317-induced suppression of invasion was associated with reduced production of activated MMP-2, IL-6 and CXCL10 by RA FLS, and with reduction of actin filament reorganization and reduced polarized formation of lamellipodia. T0901317 also prevented both IL-1β-induced and IL-6-induced FLS invasion. NF-κB (p65) and Akt activation were not significantly affected by T0901317. This is the first description of a role for LXR in the regulation of FLS invasion and in processes and pathways implicated both in invasion as well as in inflammatory responses. These findings provide a new rationale for considering LXR agonists as therapeutic agents aimed at reducing both inflammation and FLS-mediated invasion and destruction in RA.
Human Ntera2/cl.D1 (NT2) cells treated with retinoic acid (RA) differentiate towards a well characterized neuronal phenotype sharing many features with human fetal neurons. In view of the emerging role of caspases in murine stem cell/neural precursor differentiation, caspases activity was evaluated during RA differentiation. Caspase-2, -3 and -9 activity was transiently and selectively increased in differentiating and non-apoptotic NT2-cells. SiRNA-mediated selective silencing of either caspase-2 (si-Casp2) or -9 (si-Casp9) was implemented in order to dissect the role of distinct caspases. The RA-induced expression of neuronal markers, i.e. neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs and proteins, was decreased in si-Casp9, but markedly increased in si-Casp2 cells. During RA-induced NT2 differentiation, the class III histone deacetylase Sirt1, a putative caspase substrate implicated in the regulation of the proneural bHLH MASH1 gene expression, was cleaved to a ∼100 kDa fragment. Sirt1 cleavage was markedly reduced in si-Casp9 cells, even though caspase-3 was normally activated, but was not affected (still cleaved) in si-Casp2 cells, despite a marked reduction of caspase-3 activity. The expression of MASH1 mRNA was higher and occurred earlier in si-Casp2 cells, while was reduced at early time points during differentiation in si-Casp9 cells. Thus, caspase-2 and -9 may perform opposite functions during RA-induced NT2 neuronal differentiation. While caspase-9 activation is relevant for proper neuronal differentiation, likely through the fine tuning of Sirt1 function, caspase-2 activation appears to hinder the RA-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) displays an important pathogenic role. The enzymes involved in its synthesis are highly expressed in the inflamed synovium, while little is known about 15- prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) that metabolizes PGE2. Here we aimed to evaluate the localization of 15-PGDH in the synovial tissue of healthy individuals or patients with inflammatory arthritis and determine the influence of common RA therapy on its expression.
Synovial tissue specimens from healthy individuals, psoriatic arthritis, ostheoarthritis and RA patients were immunohistochemically stained to describe the expression pattern of 15-PGDH. In addition, the degree of enzyme staining was evaluated by computer analysis on stained synovial biopsies from two groups of RA patients, before and after RA specific treatment with either intra-articular glucocorticoids or oral methotrexate therapy. Prostaglandins derived from the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway were determined by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry in supernatants from interleukin (IL) 1β-activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) treated with methotrexate.
15-PGDH was present in healthy and inflamed synovial tissue, mainly in lining macrophages, fibroblasts and vessels. Intra-articular glucocorticoids showed a trend towards reduced 15-PGDH expression in RA synovium (p = 0.08) while methotrexate treatment left the PGE2 pathway unaltered both in biopsies ex vivo and in cultured FLS.
Early methotrexate therapy has little influence on the expression of 15-PGDH and on any of the PGE2 synthesizing enzymes or COX-derived metabolites. Thus therapeutic strategies involving blocking induced PGE2 synthesis may find a rationale in additionally reducing local inflammatory mediators.
Several genetic polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene are associated with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the two SNPs (T-786C and G894T) of the eNOS gene are associated with rheumatoid arthritis risk in a northern Chinese population.
In this study, the eNOS genes T-786C and G894T were studied in 196 cases with rheumatoid arthritis and 201 healthy controls with gender, age and ethnicity matched. The two SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The analyses of association were statistically compared using the chi-square test with SPSS software for Windows.
The frequency of the -786C allele was significantly higher in the rheumatoid arthritis patients than in the healthy controls (19.64% vs. 14.18%, P &lt; 0.05). However, the 894T allele of the eNOS gene was not increased in the rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to the healthy controls.
Individuals with the -786CC genotype have an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Further study with an increased sample size is necessary for the study of the role of this SNP in rheumatoid arthritis.
11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type1 (11βHSD1) regulates the conversion from inactive cortisone to active cortisol. Increased cortisol results in diabetes, hence quelling the activity of 11βHSD1 has been thought of as an effective approach for the treatment of diabetes. Quantitative hypotheses were developed and validated to identify the critical chemical features with reliable geometric constraints that contribute to the inhibition of 11βHSD1 function. The best hypothesis, Hypo1, which contains one-HBA; one-Hy-Ali, and two-RA features, was validated using Fischer's randomization method, a test and a decoy set. The well validated, Hypo1, was used as 3D query to perform a virtual screening of three different chemical databases. Compounds selected by Hypo1 in the virtual screening were filtered by applying Lipinski's rule of five, ADMET, and molecular docking. Finally, five hit compounds were selected as virtual novel hit molecules for 11βHSD1 based on their electronic properties calculated by Density functional theory.
Regulation of synthesis and turnover of retinoic acid (RA) is an important mechanism that controls the activity of RA signaling during vertebrate development. During embryonic patterning, the dynamic expression patterns of the aldh1a2 gene, which encodes a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, provide the major source of RA, whereas the only other retinaldehyde dehydrogenase in teleosts, aldh1a3, is expressed later and locally restricted. Aldh1a2-mediated RA synthesis has been shown to also regulate adult cell fates, such as during heart and fin regeneration. However, only very few other sites of postembryonic RA synthesis in vertebrates are known. We generated transgenic lines in zebrafish by BAC recombineering that express a fusion protein of Aldh1a2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of endogenous aldh1a2 regulatory sequences (aldh1a2:gfp).
aldh1a2:gfp reports the complete endogenous expression pattern in embryos and rescues embryonic lethality in aldh1a2 mutants. We identify novel postembryonic sources of RA synthesis, including lateral line support cells, in kidney-derived organs that regulate calcium homeostasis, and in perichordal cells during vertebral development.
The novel aldh1a2 reporter line is driven by the complete set of regulatory sequences required for zebrafish development, reports novel sources of RA synthesis, and identifies the source of RA that promotes vertebral ossification.
No-touch (NT) saphenous vein (SV) grafts are superior to SVs harvested by the conventional technique (CT), with a patency comparable with the internal thoracic artery (ITA). Preservation of the vasa vasorum is implicated in the success of NT harvesting. We compared the vasa vasorum and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in NT SV with ITA and radial artery (RA) grafts. Skeletonized SV (SSV) was also analyzed. The NT SV had a higher number and larger vasa vasorum compared with ITA (P = .0001) and RA (P = .0004) that correlated with eNOS protein. Activity of eNOS in SSV grafts was significantly lower than NT SV grafts (P = 004). Since a high proportion of the vasa vasorum are removed in SSV using the CT, we suggest that preservation of the vasa vasorum and eNOS-derived NO contributes to the high patency for NT as compared with SSV grafts.
Early embryogenesis in Xenopus development depends on correct anterior-posterior (A-P) neural patterning during gastrulation. It is known that high levels of retinoic acid (RA), a major intracellular signaling molecule, determine posterior cell fate, also reflecting an involvement in A-P neural patterning. Here we show that the known RA effector, xCOUP-TF, plays important roles in head development of Xenopus embryo. xCOUP-TF-B injection into the dorsal region of embryos induced formation of an abnormal head with small eyes. Analysis of brain marker gene expression revealed that xCOUP-TF-B injection induced slight anteriorization in embryos and attenuated the effects of RA treatment. This anteriorization effect was enhanced when xCOUP-TF-B was co-injected with xCyp26A or xCyp26C, which are known RA metabolizing factors. Furthermore, xCOUP-TF-B injection enhanced xCyp26A/C transcription. Together, these results suggest that xCOUP-TF and xCyp26 are both regulated by Wnt signaling, and cooperatively function in RA signaling to affect A-P neural patterning.
TBX3, a member of the T-box transcription factor gene family, is a transcriptional repressor that is required for the development of the heart, limbs, and mammary glands. Mutations in TBX3 that result in reduced functional protein lead to ulnar-mammary syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by limb, mammary gland, tooth, and genital abnormalities. Increased levels of TBX3 have been shown to contribute to the oncogenic process, and TBX3 is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, liver cancer, and melanoma. Despite its important role in development and postnatal life, little is known about the signaling pathways that modulate TBX3 expression. Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo assays, that retinoic acid (RA) activates endogenous TBX3 expression, which is mediated by an RA-receptor complex directly binding and activating the TBX3 promoter, and we provide evidence that this regulation may be functionally relevant in mouse embryonic limb development. Our data identify TBX3 as a direct target of the RA signaling pathway and extend our understanding of the role and regulation of TBX3 in limb development.
The late gestation increase in adrenal responsiveness to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) is dependent upon the upregulation of the ACTH receptor (ACTH-R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and steroidogenic enzymes in the fetal adrenal. Long-term hypoxia decreases the expression of these and adrenal responsiveness to ACTH in vivo. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone which attenuates the peripartum increase in fetal plasma cortisol is elevated in hypoxic fetuses. Therefore, we hypothesized that increases in plasma leptin will inhibit the expression of the ACTH-R, StAR, and steroidogenic enzymes and attenuate adrenal responsiveness in hypoxic fetuses. Spontaneously hypoxemic fetal sheep (132 days of gestation, PO(2) ≈ 15 mm Hg) were infused with recombinant human leptin (n = 8) or saline (n = 7) for 96 hours. An ACTH challenge was performed at 72 hours of infusion to assess adrenal responsiveness. Plasma cortisol and ACTH were measured daily and adrenals were collected after 96 hours infusion for messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression measurement. Plasma cortisol concentrations were lower in leptin- compared with saline-infused fetuses (14.8 ± 3.2 vs 42.3 ± 9.6 ng/mL, P &lt; .05), as was the cortisol:ACTH ratio (0.9 ± 0.074 vs 46 ± 1.49, P &lt; .05). Increases in cortisol concentrations were blunted in the leptin-treated group after ACTH(1-24) challenge (F = 12.2, P &lt; .0001). Adrenal ACTH-R, StAR, and P450c21 expression levels were reduced in leptin-treated fetuses (P &lt; .05), whereas the expression of Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb leptin receptor isoforms remained unchanged. Our results indicate that leptin blunts adrenal responsiveness in the late gestation hypoxemic fetus, and this effect appears mediated by decreased adrenal ACTH-R, StAR, and P450c21 expression.
A single intraperitoneal injection of a gram-positive pathogen Clostridium perfringens (Cp) causes a remarkable down-regulation the constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) with a simultaneous increase in the activity of inducible NOS (iNOS) and the level of reactive nitrogen species in the rat brain major regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus) at 48 h post-administration of Cp. Treatment by both a semiconductor laser (SCL) and/or a light-emitting diode (LED) with same wavelength, energy density and time exposure (continuous wave, λ=654 nm, fluence=1.27 J/cm(2), time exposure=600 s) could modulate brain nitrergic response following Cp-infection. Besides, unlike the LED, the SCL-irradiation prevents the cNOS inhibition in all the studied brain regions and might be useful in restoring its function in neurotransmission and cerebral blood flow, along with providing a protective effect against nitrosative stress-induced iNOS-mediated injury in the brain regions.
Fluctuations in glucose levels in diabetic patients can result in oxidative stress, resulting in an increased risk for diabetic complications. We investigated whether antioxidation would protect the kidney from oxidative stress in diabetic rats treated with insulin and provide evidence for the efficacy of antioxidant treatment in diabetes management. Diabetes was induced by injection of Streptozotocin intraperitoneally in male Wistar rats. Diabetic rats received either insulin, both insulin and Radix Astragali (RA), RA, or no treatment. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in kidney were determined. The changes of blood glucose levels and body weight were monitored. The levels of serum creatinine (Scr) were determined. The expression of PKCα was determined by western blot. NF-κB activation in kidney was assessed using EMSA. Compared to diabetic rats treated with insulin alone, the diabetic rats treated with combination of insulin and RA showed: (1) significantly lower levels of MDA, IL-6, TNF-α, and Scr (p &lt; 0.05); (2) significantly higher SOD and GSH-Px activities (p &lt; 0.05); (3) significantly lower NF-κB activation and lower expression levels of PKCα (p &lt; 0.05); (4) significantly smaller kidney-to-body weight ratio (p &lt; 0.05). RA is an effective agent in lowering oxidative stress in diabetic rats treated with insulin. Antioxidation is beneficial in reducing the risk of kidney damage due to oxidative stress in diabetic patients.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of articular cartilage and bone in a chronic phase. Pathology of rheumatoid arthritis suggests autoimmunity linked to inflammation. In our study, rheumatoid arthritis was induced in Wistar rats by intradermal injections of 100 μl of emulsion containing bovine type II collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant at the base of the tail. Disease developed about 13 ± 1 days after immunization and treatment with hesperidin (HES) at a dose of 160 mg kg(-1) body weight was given after onset of disease daily until 20th day. The effect of treatment in the rats was monitored by clinical scoring, biochemical parameters and histological evaluations in joints. A steady increase in the articular elastase, nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation was observed in joints of arthritic rats as compared to control, whereas a significant decrease in reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase activity and catalase was observed in collagen-induced arthritis rats as compared to control group. The results from the present work indicate that the treatment with hesperidin was effective in bringing about significant changes on all the parameters studied in collagen-induced arthritis rats. These data confirm that erosive destruction of the joint cartilage in collagen-induced arthritis is due free radicals released by activated neutrophils and produced by other biochemical pathways. In the present study, an attempt has been made to amelioration of the disease process by a natural product. These results suggest that oral administration of HES could be effective for treating human RA patients.
Position within a tissue often correlates with cellular phenotype, for example, differential expression of odorant receptors and cell adhesion molecules across the olfactory mucosa (OM). The association between position and phenotype is often paralleled by gradations in the concentration of retinoic acid (RA), caused by differential expression of the RA synthetic enzymes, the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH). We show here that RALDH-1, -2, and -3 are enriched in the sustentacular cells, deep fibroblasts of the lamina propria, and the superficial fibroblasts, respectively, of the ventral and lateral OM as compared to the dorsomedial OM. The shift from high to low expression of the RALDHs matches the boundary defined by the differential expression of OCAM/mamFasII. Further, we found that RA-binding proteins are expressed in the epithelium overlying the RALDH-3 expressing fibroblasts of the lamina propria. Both findings suggest that local alterations in RA concentration may be more important than a gradient of RA across the epithelial plane, per se. In addition, RALDH-3 is found in a small population of basal cells in the ventral and lateral epithelium, which expand and contribute to the neuronal lineage following MeBr lesion. Indeed, transduction with a retrovirus expressing a dominant negative form of retinoic acid receptor type alpha blocks the reappearance of mature, olfactory marker protein (OMP) (+) olfactory neurons as compared to empty vector. These results support the notion of a potential role for RA, both in maintaining the spatial organization of the normal olfactory epithelium and in reestablishing the neuronal population during regeneration after injury.
To assess the diagnostic performance of 11 commercial PR3- and MPO-ANCA ELISA systems (direct, capture and high sensitive [hs] ELISA).
Sera from 90 patients with AAV (GPA, MPA and CSS) and 20 disease controls (SLE; RA) and healthy individuals were tested for the presence of ANCA by IFT and by different ELISAs for the presence of PR3-and MPO-ANCA, respectively. Furthermore, the binding capacity of the IUIS-CDC reference sera for PR3-/MPO-ANCA in different commercial assays was analysed.
Commercial ELISA kits for PR3-ANCA differed moderately in their sensitivity (from 45% to 62.5%). The highest sensitivity for PR3-ANCA was obtained with hs ELISA (kit A) and capture ELISA (kit N). Testing for MPO-ANCA the highest sensitivity (85%) was obtained with direct ELISA (kit D and I). Specificity was high in all kits. Only three PR3-ANCA commercial kits and three MPO-ANCA kits produced binding at the expected value for the IUIS-CDC reference sera (100 U/ml). In all of the kits, serial dilutions of the reference sera did not yield linearity.
Second (capture) and third (high sensitivity) generation PR3-ANCA ELISA kits are superior to conventional ELISAs. Direct and capture MPO-ANCA ELISAs showed a good overall performance in all kits. Most of the kits have not been standardised to allow their results to be compared.
Excess morbidity/mortality in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. In this 'proof-of-concept' study, vascular function was characterized in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (mCIA) model, the benchmark choice for evaluation of the pathological processes and assessment of new therapies.
Mice in the very early stages of arthritis development [and appropriate naïve (non-immunized) age-matched controls] were used in the study. Blood pressure was measured using tail cuff plethysmography. Vascular function in rings of isolated aorta was studied with isometric tension myography. Levels of NO metabolites (NO(x)), MMP-9 protein and IL-1β in plasma and MMP-9 protein in aortic homogenates were quantified.
Impaired vascular contractile responses in arthritis were unaffected by ex vivo inhibition of NOS (endothelial/neuronal and inducible) or COX activities. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, plasma NO(x) and blood pressure were unaffected by arthritis. Plasma and aortic homogenate MMP-9 protein levels were increased significantly in arthritis. Incubation of aortic tissues from naïve control animals with exogenous MMP-9 impaired subsequent contractile responses, mirroring that observed in arthritis. A role for IL-1β in perpetuating contractile dysfunction and increasing aortic MMP-9 was excluded.
These data identify for the first time a relationship between early arthritis and contractile dysfunction and a possible role for MMP-9 therein, in the absence of overt endothelial dysfunction or increased NO production. As such, MMP-9 may constitute a significant target for early intervention in RA patients with a view to decreasing risk of cardiovascular disease.
Peptide from croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate was purified, characterized and evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Results showed that purified peptide contained the amino acid sequence as Lys-Thr-Phe-Cys-Gly-Arg-His (861.6Da), which were expected to contribute to its antioxidant activities. This peptide efficiently quenched 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals (84.5±1.2 and 62.4±2.9%), and successfully inhibits the lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and proven to be a potent antioxidant at different in vitro systems. It also improved the endogenous cellular antioxidant enzymes in Wistar rat by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) after supplementation of the peptide (283.6±7.25, 4.3±0.78 and 28.42±1.97) compared to the negative control (196.4±5.65, 1.3±0.45 and 15.1±0.35). Therefore, croaker muscle peptide can increase an endurance capacity and facilitate recovery from oxidative stress.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by hypoxia and the expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which coordinate cellular responses to hypoxia. The objective of this study was to analyze the expression and regulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes and factor-inhibiting HIF-1α (FIH-1), which regulate cellular HIF levels, and to study the roles of these enzymes in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA FLS).
The expression of PHD and FIH and downstream target genes was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach and an in vitro endothelial cell angiogenesis assay were used to analyze the roles of HIF hydroxylases.
In human RA FLS, knockdown of PHD-2, but not knockdown of PHD-1 or FIH-1, dramatically augmented HIF-1α expression, modestly increased HIF-2α protein expression under normoxic conditions, and up-regulated HIF-dependent gene expression. In contrast, silencing of PHD-3 up-regulated HIF-2α but reduced HIF-1α, thereby decreasing the expression of HIF-regulated genes. A similar effect of PHD-2 knockdown was observed in osteoarthritis FLS (OA FLS) but not in nondiseased primary human dermal fibroblasts. These findings correlated with the induction of in vitro angiogenesis by supernatants from RA FLS and OA FLS transfected with siPHD-2 but not by supernatants from nondiseased fibroblasts or from siPHD-3-transfected cells.
Our data suggest that PHD-2 is the major hydroxylase regulating HIF levels and the expression of angiogenic genes in arthritic cells. PHD-2 appears to regulate responses relevant to arthritis via HIF-α, highlighting the major importance of this enzyme in hypoxia- and angiogenesis-dependent inflammatory diseases such as RA.
Paeoniae radix is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb for treating some diseases; important components are total paeony glycosides (TPGs), an approved drug by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We firstly reported myocardial benefits of TPGs previously, and the present study is to further investigate the underlying mechanisms for preventing oxidative damage in cardiomyopathy. We measured the capacity of TPGs to scavenge free radicals in vitro. Then 60 SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: (1) a normal control group, (2) an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemic model group, (3) a TPG treatment group (TPGs 269.4 mg/kg delivered by intragastric administration for 3 days before ISO administration and TPGs 449 mg/kg delivered for 3 days after ISO administration), (4) a TPG therapy group (TPGs 449 mg/kg delivered for 3 days after ISO administration), and (5) a positive control group (propranolol 15 mg/kg for 3 days after ISO administration). The ISO-induced myocardial ischemic model was established by subcutaneous injection of 1mg/kg/8h ISO (2 times). The activities of myocardial enzymes, including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the content of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected. We found that TPGs potently eliminated hydroxyl radicals and superoxide in vitro using ESR assays. Compared with model rats, TPG treatment, TPG therapy and the positive control treatment exhibited significantly reduced activities of GOT, LDH, and CK (p &lt; 0.01), increased activity of SOD (p &lt; 0.01) and lower levels of MDA (p &lt; 0.05). More interestingly, the protective effect of TPG treatment was even better than that of propranolol. These results suggest that TPGs significantly ameliorate ISO-induced myocardial ischemia and their action might be through reducing oxidative stress in ischemic myocardium.
The aim of this work was to determine the localization of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity as the marker for synthesis of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the rat thymus after the application of retinoid acid (RA) on 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st days of gestation. The given results can build the basis for understanding of the role of NOS in rat thymus. NADPH-d positive cells were represented with dark-blue color and were localized on corticomedullar junction of the thymus. These cells were of different intensity of coloring and were shaped in oval, circle or irregular forms. NADPH-d positive nerve fibers were observed in perivascular topography. They were marked more strongly in the case of control group. The result of application of RA to gravid rats was that the birth weights of newborn rats and their thymuses were smaller, but without statistically significance.
Allergic asthma has emerged as an important public health problem of urban populations in developed countries. Very often herbal medicine is used to treat this widespread disease, due to the lack of efficacy and the important side effects related to the classical drugs in use. Along this line, Ocimum gratissimum (Og) is a plant widely used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat inflammatory disorders, such as asthma. In the present study we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of Og and rosmarinic acid (RA, a polyphenolic compound) in a murine model of respiratory allergy induced by the Blomia tropicalis (Bt) mite. The respiratory allergy was induced in A/J mice by administration of Bt extract and the treatment was done using 25, 50 or 100mg/kg of an Og methanolic extract or using 2, 20 or 200mg/kg of RA. We then evaluated the changes induced by these drugs on immunological parameters related to the allergic process, which are up-regulated in this allergic model. The treatment of animals with 100mg/Kg Og and 200mg/Kg RA led to a significant reduction in the numbers of leukocytes/eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); eosinophil peroxidase activity in BAL; presence of mucus in respiratory tract, histopathological changes in the lung, and IL-4 in BAL. These results suggest that the methanolic extract of Og and the polyphenol RA have therapeutic potential in this murine model of respiratory allergy to a clinically relevant human sensitizer allergen.
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and tocilizumab [TCZ] (an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the condition. As up-regulation of IL-6 reduces the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, blockade of this cytokine may enhance CYP function. This may lead to reduced bioavailability of CYP-metabolized drugs. Due to the increasing use of TCZ, we undertook a systematic literature review to explore such interactions. Our search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, FDA and EMEA websites for in vitro and in vivo studies, clinical trials and reviews mentioning TCZ and CYP on the basis of the title and abstract. Appropriate articles were further screened based on full-text review to select only those reporting IL-6, TCZ and their potential interaction with CYP-metabolized drugs. Two in vitro studies showed that TCZ-reversed IL-6 induced reduction of CYP isozymes. CYP3A4 mRNA expression was most reduced by IL-6 followed by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. This change was prevented with TCZ. Three clinical studies investigated the interaction showing simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) bioavailability reduced by TCZ and omeprazole bioavailability was decreased by TCZ-induced CYP2C19 activity. The bioavailability of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrates) was shown to be unaffected by TCZ treatment. The observed increase in CYP isozyme activity by TCZ is of clinical relevance as the bioavailability of the CYP isozyme substrates were decreased in vivo. As CYP3A4 is the isozyme responsible for the largest proportion of drug metabolism, it is probable that the bioavailability of other drugs may be reduced by TCZ. Thus, clinicians should exercise caution when co-prescribing TCZ and CYP-metabolized drugs. More studies are required to investigate this interaction further.
Thymoquinone (TQ) is the major active compound derived from Nigella sativa. Our aim of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant and antiarthritic activity of TQ in Wistar rat by collagen induced arthritis (CIA). TQ was administered at a dose of 5mgkg(-1) body weight once daily for 21days. The effects of treatment in the rats were assessed by biochemical (articular elastase, MPO, LPO, GSH, catalase, SOD and NO), inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ and PGE(2)) and histological studies in joints. TQ was effective in bringing significant changes on all the parameters (articular elastase, MPO, LPO, GSH, catalase, SOD and NO) studied. Oral administration of TQ resulted in significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ and PGE(2)) and increased level of IL-10. The protective effects of TQ against RA were also evident from the decrease in arthritis scoring and bone histology. In conclusion, the fact that TQ abolished a number of factors known to be involved in RA pathogenesis indicates that the administration of thymoquinone may have potential value in the treatment of inflammatory disease.
Human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAM-MSCs) are capable of differentiating into several lineages and possess immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the soluble factor-mediated immunomodulatory effects of hAM-MSCs. Mitogen-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation was suppressed by hAM-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner as well as hAM-MSC culture supernatant. Moreover, interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 production significantly decreased from PBMC, whereas IL-10 from PBMCs and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) production from hAM-MSCs significantly increased in co-cultures of hAM-MSCs and PBMCs. Production of several MSC factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), TGF-β, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), increased significantly in hAM-MSCs co-cultured with PBMCs. These results indicate that the immunomodulatory effects of hAM-MSCs may be associated with soluble factors (TGF-β, HGF, PGE2, and IDO), suggesting that hAM-MSCs may have potential clinical use in regenerative medicine.
While the biological importance of the cytochrome P450 system in the liver is well established, much less is known about its role in the brain and drug interactions at the level of brain cells have hardly been investigated. Here, we show that modafinil, a well-known inducer of hepatic CYP enzymes, also increases CYP3A4 expression in human-derived neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Upregulation of CYP3A4 by modafinil was associated with increased retinoic acid (RA) degradation, which could be blocked by specific CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin. In turn, reduced RA levels in culture medium during modafinil treatment resulted in decreased neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells as assessed by intracellular neurotransmitter concentrations and proliferative activity. Again, this differentiation-impeding effect of modafinil on SH-SY5Y cells was antagonized by erythromycin. Similarly, modafinil treatment of the murine GL261 glioma cell line resulted in increased proliferative activity. This was associated with upregulation of RA-degrading CYP26A1 in GL261 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that psychopharmacological agents such as modafinil may directly act on CYP enzymes in neural tissue. These kinds of drug effects may become highly relevant especially in the context of biomolecules such as RA whose local metabolism in brain is under tight spatial and temporal control.
To test the sensitivity to change of ultrasonographic endpoints in early phase clinical trials in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
A double-blind, placebo and comparator controlled, randomised, two-centre study investigated the effect on synovial thickness and vascularity of 28 days repeat daily oral dosing of 60 mg of the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor GW274150 or 7.5 mg prednisolone in RA. Fifty patients with DAS28 scores ≥4.0 were assigned to 3 treatment arms of 17, 19 and 14 (on placebo, GW274150 and prednisolone respectively). Synovial thickness and vascularity of all 10 metacarpophalangeal joints were assessed by ultrasonography using a semi-quantitative scale at baseline (Day 1), Day 15 and Day 28. Vascularity was also measured quantitatively by power Doppler area.
At Day 28, the GW274150 group showed a trend towards reduction in synovial thickness compared with placebo, with an adjusted mean decrease of 33% (p=0.072); the prednisolone group decreased significantly by 44% (p=0.011). Similarly, there was a trend to reduced synovial vascularity with GW274150 by 42% compared with placebo (p=0.075); prednisolone resulted in a statistically significant decrease of 55% (p=0.012). There was a 55% decrease in power Doppler area for GW274150, compared with placebo although the result was not statistically significant (p=0.375). Prednisolone 7.5 mg resulted in a highly statistically significant decrease of 95% (p=0.003).
This study advocates the use of ultrasonographic measures of metacarpophalangeal joint synovitis as an endpoint for clinical studies assessing therapeutic potential of new compounds in small patient cohorts over 28 days.
Studies in avian models have demonstrated an involvement of retinoid signaling in early neural tube patterning. The roles of this signaling pathway at later stages of spinal cord development are only partly characterized. Here we use Raldh2-null mouse mutants rescued from early embryonic lethality to study the consequences of lack of endogenous retinoic acid (RA) in the differentiating spinal cord. Mid-gestation RA deficiency produces prominent structural and molecular deficiencies in dorsal regions of the spinal cord. While targets of Wnt signaling in the dorsal neuronal lineage are unaltered, reductions in Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Notch signaling are clearly observed. We further provide evidence that endogenous RA is capable of driving stem cell differentiation. Raldh2 deficiency results in a decreased number of spinal cord derived neurospheres, which exhibit a reduced differentiation potential. Raldh2-null neurospheres have a decreased number of cells expressing the neuronal marker β-III-tubulin, while the nestin-positive cell population is increased. Hence, in vivo retinoid deficiency impaired neural stem cell growth. We propose that RA has separable functions in the developing spinal cord to (i) maintain high levels of FGF and Notch signaling and (ii) drive stem cell differentiation, thus restricting both the numbers and the pluripotent character of neural stem cells.
MTHFR polymorphisms C677T and A1298C are associated with reduced MTHFR enzyme activity and hyperhomocysteinemia, which has been associated with osteoporosis. The A163G polymorphism in osteoprotegerin (OPG) has been studied in osteoporosis with controversial results. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association(s) among MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, and OPG A163G polymorphisms in Mexican patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. The femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral densities (BMDs) were measured in 71 RA patients, and genotyping for the three polymorphisms was performed via restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia exhibited statistically significant differences in the genotype frequencies of MTHFR C677T as well as an association with femoral neck BMD; TT homozygotes had lower BMDs than patients with the CT genotype, and both of these groups had lower BMDs than patients with the CC genotype. The associations of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism with osteoporosis/osteopenia and femoral neck BMD suggest that these polymorphisms confer a risk of developing osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a risk that may be reduced with folate and B complex supplementation.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a variable disease outcome, and is characterized by inflammation of multiple joints. Proinflammtory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6) are thought to play crucial roles in the pathology of RA. The prognosis of patients with RA has improved significantly with the recent availability of biologics targeting TNFα and IL-6. Immunization of DBA/1 mice with glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) induces severe acute arthritis. This arthritis can be controlled by TNFα antagonists, suggesting similar etiology to RA. We performed GeneChip analysis using splenocytes of mice with GPI-induced arthritis. Among the arrayed TNFα-related genes, the expression of TNFα-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP) mRNA was the highest. TIARP was detected specifically in joints and spleens of arthritic mice. Among the splenocytes, CD11b(+) cells were the main source of TIARP mRNA. STEAP4 (the human ortholog of TIARP) was highly upregulated in joints of patients with RA and especially co-localized with CD68(+) macrophages. In this study, we discuss the role of TIARP in the generation of experimental autoimmune arthritis and the possible clinical application of for the treatment of RA.
The process by which the periderm transitions to stratified epidermis with the establishment of the skin barrier is unknown. Understanding the cellular and molecular processes involved is crucial for the treatment of human pathologies, where abnormal skin development and barrier dysfunction are associated with hypothermia and perinatal dehydration. For the first time, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) levels are important for periderm desquamation, embryonic skin differentiation and barrier formation. Although excess exogenous RA has been known to have teratogenic effects, little is known about the consequences of elevated endogenous retinoids in skin during embryogenesis. Absence of cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily b, polypeptide 1 (Cyp26b1), a retinoic-acid-degrading enzyme, results in aberrant epidermal differentiation and filaggrin expression, defective cornified envelopes and skin barrier formation, in conjunction with peridermal retention. We show that these alterations are RA dependent because administration of exogenous RA in vivo and to organotypic skin cultures phenocopy Cyp26b1(-/-) skin abnormalities. Furthermore, utilizing the Flaky tail (Ft/Ft) mice, a mouse model for human ichthyosis, characterized by mutations in the filaggrin gene, we establish that proper differentiation and barrier formation is a prerequisite for periderm sloughing. These results are important in understanding pathologies associated with abnormal embryonic skin development and barrier dysfunction.
Retinoic acid (RA) is known to regulate definitive myelopoiesis but its role in vertebrate primitive myelopoiesis remains unclear. Here we report that zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis is restricted by RA in a dose dependent manner mainly before 11 hpf (hours post fertilization) when anterior hemangioblasts are initiated to form. RA treatment significantly reduces expressions of anterior hemangioblast markers scl, lmo2, gata2 and etsrp in the rostral end of ALPM (anterior lateral plate mesoderm) of the embryos. The result indicates that RA restricts primitive myelopoiesis by suppressing formation of anterior hemangioblasts. Analyses of ALPM formation suggest that the defective primitive myelopoiesis resulting from RA treatment before late gastrulation may be secondary to global loss of cells for ALPM fate whereas the developmental defect resulting from RA treatment during 10-11 hpf should be due to ALPM patterning shift. Overexpressions of scl and lmo2 partially rescue the block of primitive myelopoiesis in the embryos treated with 250 nM RA during 10-11 hpf, suggesting RA acts upstream of scl to control primitive myelopoiesis. However, the RA treatment blocks the increased primitive myelopoiesis caused by overexpressing gata4/6 whereas the abolished primitive myelopoiesis in gata4/5/6 depleted embryos is well rescued by 4-diethylamino-benzaldehyde, a retinal dehydrogenase inhibitor, or partially rescued by knocking down aldh1a2, the major retinal dehydrogenase gene that is responsible for RA synthesis during early development. Consistently, overexpressing gata4/6 inhibits aldh1a2 expression whereas depleting gata4/5/6 increases aldh1a2 expression. The results reveal that RA signaling acts downstream of gata4/5/6 to control primitive myelopoiesis. But, 4-diethylamino-benzaldehyde fails to rescue the defective primitive myelopoiesis in either cloche embryos or lycat morphants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RA signaling restricts zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis through acting downstream of gata4/5/6, upstream of, or parallel to, cloche, and upstream of scl.
The plasticity of lignin biosynthesis should permit the inclusion of new compatible phenolic monomers, such as rosmarinic acid (RA) and analogous catechol derivatives, into cell-wall lignins that are consequently less recalcitrant to biomass processing. In vitro lignin polymerization experiments revealed that RA readily underwent peroxidase-catalyzed copolymerization with monolignols and lignin oligomers to form polymers with new benzodioxane inter-unit linkages. Incorporation of RA permitted extensive depolymerization of synthetic lignins by mild alkaline hydrolysis, presumably by cleavage of ester intra-unit linkages within RA. Copolymerization of RA with monolignols into maize cell walls by in situ peroxidases significantly enhanced alkaline lignin extractability and promoted subsequent cell wall saccharification by fungal enzymes. Incorporating RA also improved cell wall saccharification by fungal enzymes and by rumen microflora even without alkaline pretreatments, possibly by modulating lignin hydrophobicity and/or limiting cell wall cross-linking. Consequently, we anticipate that bioengineering approaches for partial monolignol substitution with RA and analogous plant hydroxycinnamates would permit more efficient utilization of plant fiber for biofuels or livestock production.
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between arrhythmia occurrence and nerve remodeling of thoracic spinal cord 1-5 nerves as well as myocardial electrophysiological remodeling in a metal stress rat model.
Thirty SD rats (weight 180-250 g) were randomly divided into control group (n = 10), stress group (n = 10) and fluoxetine group (n = 10, 10 mg/kg i.p. for 3 weeks). Stress model (given by unpredicted chronic mild stress) was established according to Cronli's protocol. Following parameters were observed:(1) ECG waveform change and arrhythmias;(2) tissue field action potential duration (FAPD) of thoracic spinal cord 1-5 and cardiac tissue mapped by microelectrode arrays (MEA) technique;(3) myocardial growth-associated protein (GAP-43), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) distribution observed by immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscope (LSCM).
Three weeks later: (1) The body weight, food intake, consumption of sugar water, the horizontal and vertical movement score, cleaning action of rats were significantly decreased, and fecal grains significantly increased, P-wave, P-R interval, QRS-wave and Q-T interval were significantly prolonged and heart rate was significantly reduced in stress group compared with control group (all P &lt; 0.05). Incidence of ventricular premature beat was 80% in stress group and 0% in control group (P &lt; 0.05). The FAPD of thoracic spinal cord 1-5 nerves [(144.25 ± 12.63)ms vs (79.56 ± 8.01)ms] and of cardiac tissue [LA(122.43 ± 19.34)ms vs (92.59 ± 7.61)ms, RA(149.89 ± 14.68)ms vs (105.18 ± 15.94)ms, LV(162.62 ± 7.04)ms vs (110.45 ± 6.92)ms, RV(152.21 ± 30.49)ms vs (131.06 ± 12.04)ms] were significantly prolonged, FAPD dispersion (FAPDd) significantly increased [thoracic spinal cord 1-5(13.3 ± 9.11)ms vs (9.36 ± 7.01)ms] in stress group compared with the control group. Disarrangement of myocardial cells, proliferation of collagen fiber, infiltration of neutrophil and lymphocytes in the cardiac tissue were also observed and distribution of GAP-43, TH and CHAT was significantly increased in stress group. (2) All these changes could be partly reversed by the treatment with fluoxetine.
Metal stress induced cardiac autonomic nerve and myocardial electrophysiological remodeling and ventricular arrhythmia in rats which could be significantly attenuated by fluoxetine in this model.
We investigated the effects of hypoxia on inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity and expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocytes. We further studied the relationship between nitrosative stress and NADPH oxidase (NOX) in such conditions. Human cultured synoviocytes were treated for 24 hours with IL-1β, TNF-α or neither, and submitted to hypoxia or normoxia for the last 6 hours. Nitrite production and iNOS expression were increased under hypoxia conditions in RA cells in comparison to normoxia. Hypoxia did not potentate the basal and cytokine-induced superoxide productions, while NOXs' subunit expression and p47-phox phosphorylation were increased. Nitrosylation of NOXs and p47-phox was not raised under hypoxia conditions. Finally, peroxynitrite production was significantly increased under hypoxia conditions, in comparison to normoxia. Our results provide evidence for upregulation of iNOS and NOX activities in RA synoviocytes under hypoxia conditions, associated to an increased peroxynitrite production. Synovial cell metabolism under hypoxia conditions might be different from that in normoxia.
Sinomenine (1) is clinically available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), however, its efficacy is quite weak. In the present study, a library of novel sinomenine-based homodimers and monomers through variable-length linkers were designed and synthesized, and their bioactivities were evaluated using RAW264.7 cells and mice. Among the compounds, 2f and 3b possessed much more potent inhibitory effects on the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) than 1. Preliminary mechanism investigation revealed that 3b inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway specifically, 2f suppressed both NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Moreover, 3b and 2f significantly alleviated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mortality. These two compounds might serve as valuable candidates for anti-inflammatory drug discovery.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which degrades Heme to free iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide (CO) plays an important role in inflammation. There are, however, conflicting data concerning the role of HO-1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the therapeutic potential of individual heme degradation products remains to be determined. We therefore investigated the effect of CO and biliverdin upon therapeutic administration in the murine collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA.
CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice. Anti-CII antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Mice were scored for paw swelling and grip strength. After the first clinical signs of arthritis one group of animals was treated with biliverdin, the second group was treated with CO. After 60 days all animals were sacrificed and analysed for histomorphological signs of arthritis.
All animals immunised with CII developed serum anti-CII antibodies. Antibody levels were decreased in the CO-treated group. Both, Biliverdin and the CO-treated animals, showed an improvement in clinical disease activity. Histological analysis revealed significantly less inflammation, erosion and reduced numbers of osteoclasts in CO-treated animals only, whereas cartilage degradation was prevented in both biliverdin and CO-treated animals.
Our data demonstrate a beneficial effect of CO, in particular, and biliverdin, on inflammation and bone destruction in the CIA mouse model.
Identifying genetic predictors of methotrexate (MTX) treatment response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may have great importance for optimising drug doses required for clinical benefit without toxicity. In a group of 125 RA patients treated with MTX we investigated whether selected polymorphisms in genes relevant for MTX action (aminoimidazole-4-carboxiamide ribonucleotide transformylase, ATIC, and dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR) modulate disease activity and/or have impact on therapy side effects.
The efficacy of treatment was estimated both by the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), based on EULAR criteria, and relative DAS28 (rDAS28) score. Adverse drug events (ADEs) were also recorded. RA patients were genotyped using the PCR-RFLP method, followed by an association study between ATIC -129T&gt;G, DHFR -216T&gt;C and DHFR -317A&gt;G polymorphisms and the efficacy and toxicity of MTX.
According to the EULAR response criteria, 96 RA patients (76.8%) were classified as responders (good/moderate response) and 29 (23.2%) as non-responders (poor response). rDAS28 values ranged from -0.01 to 0.80 (mean value 0.31±0.19). Among 125 patients enrolled in this study 39 experienced at least one side effect. The DHFR -317AA genotype was associated with the less favourable response (reduction in rDAS28 score, p=0.05). None of the analysed polymorphisms was associated with MTX toxicity.
RA patients with DHFR-317AA genotype had less favourable response to MTX. Further studies in larger patient populations are necessary to confirm the relationship between the analysed polymorphisms and MTX treatment response.
All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) has been implicated in the local regulation of scleral proteoglycan synthesis in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to identify the enzymes involved in the synthesis of atRA during visually guided ocular growth, the cells involved in modulation of atRA biosynthesis in the choroid, and the effect of choroid-derived atRA on scleral proteoglycan synthesis.
Myopia was induced in White leghorn chicks by form deprivation for 10 days, followed by up to 15 days of unrestricted vision (recovery). Expression of atRA synthesizing enzymes was evaluated by semiquantitative qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. atRA synthesis was measured in organ cultures of isolated choroids using LC-tandem MS quantification. Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was measured in vitro by the incorporation of (35)SO(4) in CPC-precipitable glycosaminoglycans. RESULTS; RALDH2 was the predominant RALDH transcript in the choroid (&gt; 100-fold that of RALDH3). RALDH2 mRNA was elevated after 12 and 24 hours of recovery (60% and 188%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). The atRA concentration was significantly higher in cultures of choroids from 24-hour to 15-day recovering eyes than in paired controls (-195%; P &lt; 0.01). Choroid conditioned medium from recovering choroids inhibited proteoglycan synthesis to 43% of controls (P &lt; 0.02, paired t-test; n = 16) and produced a relative inhibition corresponding to a RA concentration of 7.20 × 10(-8) M.
The results of this study suggest that RALDH2 is the major retinal dehydrogenase in the chick choroid and is responsible for increased atRA synthesis in response to myopic defocus.
Retinoic Acid (RA) is a small lipophilic signaling molecule essential for embryonic development and adult tissue maintenance. Both an excess of RA and a deficiency of RA can cause pathogenic anomalies, hence it is critical to understand the mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of RA. However, our current understanding of these processes remains incomplete. Vitamin A is metabolized to RA via two sequential enzymatic reactions. The first requires retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) activity to oxidize Vitamin A (retinol) to retinal, and the second requires retinaldehyde activity (RALDH) to oxidize retinal into RA. The first reaction has previously been attributed to the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family, whose genes are ubiquitously or redundantly expressed. Consequently, the specificity of RA synthesis was thought to reside exclusively at the level of the second reaction. To better understand the metabolism of Vitamin A into RA during embryogenesis, we generated new mouse models that disrupt this process. Here we describe a new targeted knockout of Rdh10 in which RA synthesis is severely impaired, particularly at critical early embryonic stages. We also introduce a new mutant allele of Aldh1a2. Both mutations produce similar developmental defects resulting in lethality around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The severity of the Rdh10 null phenotype demonstrates that embryonic oxidation of retinol is carried out primarily by RDH10 and that neither ADHs nor other enzymes contribute significantly to this reaction. We also show that reduced RA production results in upregulation of Rdh10. These data demonstrate that RDH10 plays a critical role in mediating the rate limiting RDH step of Vitamin A metabolism and functions as a nodal point in feedback regulation of RA synthesis. Moreover, RDH10-mediated oxidation of retinol plays as important a role in the control and regulation of RA production during embryogenesis as does the subsequent RALDH-mediated reaction.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a vitamin A-derived, non-peptidic, small lipophilic molecule that acts as ligand for nuclear RA receptors (RARs), converting them from transcriptional repressors to activators. The distribution and levels of RA in embryonic tissues are tightly controlled by regulated synthesis through the action of specific retinol and retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and by degradation via specific cytochrome P450s (CYP26s). Recent studies indicate that RA action involves an interplay between diffusion (morphogen-like) gradients and the establishment of signalling boundaries due to RA metabolism, thereby allowing RA to finely control the differentiation and patterning of various stem/progenitor cell populations. Here, we provide an overview of the RA biosynthesis, degradation and signalling pathways and review the main functions of this molecule during embryogenesis.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a key pro-inflammatory mediator. It plays an important role part in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and immune diseases. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MIF -173 G/C is known to influence MIF promoter activity in T lymphoblast cell lines and is associated with a higher serum MIF level. The CD40 is also crucial for some relevant functions of the immune system and may be related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). And CD226 is an important cell-surface receptor molecule involved in the adhesion and activation of T-cell. We hypothesized that these polymorphisms may contribute to RA susceptibility. We studied MIF -173 G/C, CD40, and CD226 gene polymorphisms in 214 patients with RA and 478 controls in a Chinese population. Genotyping was done by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). When the MIF -173 GG homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for RA. In the recessive model, when the MIF -173 GG/GC genotypes were used as the reference group, the CC homozygote genotype was associated with a significant 1.56-fold increased susceptibility to RA. None of the CD40 rs1883832 C/T and CD226 rs763361 C/T polymorphisms achieved a significant difference in genotype distributions between cases and controls. In the stratification analyzes, a significantly increased risk for RA associated with the MIF -173 CC genotype was evident among CRP-negative patients compared with the MIF -173 GG/GC genotype. For the CD40 rs1883832 C/T variant, the risk effects of CD40 rs1883832 TT versus CD40 rs1883832 CC/CT were significant in men. These findings suggested that the functional SNP MIF -173 G/C variant allele was associated with the development of RA. However, CD40 and CD226 gene polymorphisms may not be associated with RA susceptibility. Due to the limitation of sample size, this study should be considered preliminary.
Melanocytes in the human epidermis actively produce and secrete various substances, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the skin homeostasis. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin D(2)  (PGD(2) ) may be one of such secreted molecules. Once secreted, L-PGDS functions as a transporter for lipophilic ligands, including all-trans retinoic acid (RA). L-PGDS, therefore, may possess pleiotropic functions in the skin through PGD(2)  and RA. We aimed to identify the cell types that express L-PGDS in human skin and to explore the role of L-PGDS in the growth potential of melanocyte-lineage cells. Immunohistochemical analysis for L-PGDS expression was performed with the tissue sections that were prepared from five malignant melanomas, six nevus cell nevi and one Spitz nevus. Normal skin tissues adjacent to the excised melanoma tissues were also analyzed. L-PGDS is expressed in epidermal melanocytes but its expression is undetectable in keratinocytes. Moreover, L-PGDS is undetectable in most benign nevus cells, which may reflect the marginally accelerated proliferation of nevus cells. In contrast, L-PGDS is overexpressed in malignant melanomas, although the frequency of L-PGDS-positive cells was variable (15-50%), depending on the specimens. Lastly, RNA interference analysis against human L-PGDS was performed with short interfering RNA. Knockdown of L-PGDS expression with short interfering RNA in cultured cells suggests that L-PGDS may restrict cell proliferation through RA. In conclusion, L-PGDS expression may contribute to the restricted proliferation of epidermal melanocytes, but conversely its overexpression may reflect the dysregulated proliferation of melanoma cells.
Impairment of endogenous differentiation pathways like retinoic acid (RA) signaling seems to be a central pathogenetic event in astrocytic gliomas. Among others, expression of the differentiation-promoting RA chaperon protein cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) is extenuated in high-grade gliomas. Against this background, we aimed at identifying potential pathomechanisms underlying reduced CRABP2 expression in these tumors. Using MassARRAY methylation analysis, we detected extensive CpG methylation upstream of the CRABP2 gene locus in a study sample comprising 100 astrocytic gliomas of WHO Grade II to IV. Compared to nontumorous control samples, tumors revealed increased CpG methylation and methylation levels were inversely correlated to CRABP2 mRNA expression. Substantiating our in situ findings, CRABP2 mRNA levels increased in glioma cell lines after exposure to the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Finally, a distinct CpG methylation signature distinguished between primary glioblastoma on the one hand and the group of astrocytoma WHO II-III and secondary glioblastoma on the other hand. Altogether, our observations suggest that epigenetic silencing of CRABP2 might contribute to an immature phenotype in glioma cells.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly targets the synovial membrane, cartilage and bone. It affects 1 % of the population and is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality. Se is an essential trace element with antioxidant properties and the ability to modulate the immune responses. Selemax® is an inactive yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) enriched with organic Se. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Selemax® administration in models of an antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in C57BL/6 mice, and of an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AdIA) in Holtzman rats. As control, the animals were treated with the same inactivated yeast species that was not enriched for Se. In the AIA model, treatment with different doses of Selemax® (0·01, 0·1, 1 and 10 % added to food) significantly decreased the number of inflammatory cells recruited to the knee cavity, essentially by reducing the number of neutrophils. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1/keratinocyte chemoattractant (CXCL1/KC), were also reduced in the peri-articular tissue of mice treated with Selemax® at the tested dose (1 %). In the AdIA model in rats, Selemax® treatment decreased paw oedema and hypernociception. This reduction was associated with inhibition of the influx of proinflammatory cells. Therefore, treatment with Selemax® is associated with amelioration of several inflammatory and functional parameters in models of arthritis, suggesting that this Se-enriched yeast should be evaluated further in patients with RA.
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a major antiatherogenic function of high density lipoprotein (HDL). In the current work, the authors evaluated whether the RCT capacity of HDL from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is impaired when compared to healthy controls.
HDL was isolated from 40 patients with RA and 40 age and sex matched healthy controls. Assays of cholesterol efflux, HDL's antioxidant function and paraoxanase-1 (PON-1) activity were performed as described previously. Plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assessed by a commercially available assay.
Mean cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL was not significantly different between RA patients (40.2% ± 11.1%) and controls (39.5% ± 8.9%); p=0.75. However, HDL from RA patients with high disease activity measured by a disease activity score using 28 joint count (DAS28&gt;5.1), had significantly decreased ability to promote cholesterol efflux compared to HDL from patients with very low disease activity/clinical remission (DAS28&lt;2.6). Significant correlations were noted between cholesterol efflux and the DAS28 (r=-0.39, p=0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, (r=-0.41, p=0.0009). Higher plasma MPO activity was associated with worse HDL function (r=0.41/p=0.009 (antioxidant capacity); r=0.35, p=0.03 (efflux)). HDL's ability to promote cholesterol efflux was modestly but significantly correlated with its antioxidant function (r=-0.34, p=0.03).
The cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL is impaired in RA patients with high disease activity and is correlated with systemic inflammation and HDL's antioxidant capacity. Attenuation of HDL function, independent of HDL cholesterol levels, may suggest a mechanism by which active RA contributes to increased cardiovascular (CV) risk.
The present study investigated the effects of Radix Astragali (RA) and Radix Rehmanniae (RR), the major components of an anti-diabetic foot ulcer herbal formula (NF3), on the metabolism of model probe substrates of human CYP isoforms, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4, which are important in the metabolism of a variety of xenobiotics. The effects of RA or RR on human CYP1A2 (phenacetin O-deethylase), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide 4-hydroxylase), CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan O-demethylase), CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase) and CYP3A4 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylase) activities were investigated using pooled human liver microsomes. NF3 competitively inhibited activities of CYP2C9 (IC(50)=0.98mg/ml) and CYP3A4 (IC(50)=0.76mg/ml), with K(i) of 0.67 and 1.0mg/ml, respectively. With specific human CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isoforms, NF3 competitively inhibited activities of CYP2C9 (IC(50)=0.86mg/ml) and CYP3A4 (IC(50)=0.88mg/ml), with K(i) of 0.57 and 1.6mg/ml, respectively. Studies on RA or RR individually showed that RR was more important in the metabolic interaction with the model CYP probe substrates. RR dose-dependently inhibited the testosterone 6β-hydroxylation (K(i)=0.33mg/ml) while RA showed only minimal metabolic interaction potential with the model CYP probe substrates studied. This study showed that RR and the NF3 formula are metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and/or CYP3A4, but weakly by CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. The relatively high K(i) values of NF3 (for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 metabolism) and RR (for CYP3A4 metabolism) would suggest a low potential for NF3 to cause herb-drug interaction involving these CYP isoforms.
The role of oral bacterial infections including periodontal disease in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has gained increasing interest. Among the major periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis has been mostly associated with RA pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of P. gingivalis total lipid (TL) fraction and dihydroceramides, as potent virulence factors, on human primary chondrocytes. Primary chondrocyte cultures were incubated with P. gingivalis phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PG DHC) lipids, the TL fraction or phosphoethanolamine dihydroceramide. Cell morphology changes were determined by phase contrast light microscopy. Early and late apoptosis cell analysis was performed by Annexin-V, active caspases, and 7-Aminoactinomycin D staining, and examined by flow cytometry, and cell necrosis was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Procaspase-3 activation was determined by Western blot analysis. Microscopic analysis showed altered cell morphology and cell shrinkage following incubation with P. gingivalis TLs and PG DHC lipids. Flow cytometry demonstrated an increase of Annexin-V positive and active caspases positive chondrocytes after incubation with TL and PG DHC fractions but not after phosphoethanolamine dihydroceramide (control lipid) treatment or in untreated control cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed an early cleavage of procaspase-3 after 1 hr. Significant lactate dehydrogenase release following incubation with P. gingivalis lipids was demonstrated. The present data demonstrate that P. gingivalis lipids promote apoptosis in primary human chondrocytes, and thereby may contribute to the joint damage seen in the pathogenesis of RA.
Proinflammatory cytokines play a role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease (ACD), which is a common cause of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anemia in RA is associated with increased apoptosis of erythroid cells. However, there is unclear information on the mechanism of ACD in the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of cytokines on nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells of ACD in RA patients. Erythroid progenitor cells from healthy subjects and RA patients with ACD were treated with cytokines like interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ at concentrations of 2, 20, and 40 ng/ml for 14 days. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were analyzed by trypan blue staining and flow cytometry, respectively. The results showed that the highest effect of cytokines on reduction cell viability and induction cell apoptosis was found in 20 ng/ml IFN-γ-treated cells of RA patients. In addition, IFN-γ showed significantly increased nitric oxide production and iNOS mRNA expression, which was measured by Griess assay and real-time PCR, respectively. The percentage of cell apoptosis and NO production was reduced after an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, SMT, treatment. In conclusion, IFN-γ could induce nitric oxide production-mediated apoptosis process, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of ACD in RA patients.
The requirement for vitamin A in reproduction was first recognized in the early 1900's, and its importance in the eyes of developing embryos was realized shortly after. A greater understanding of the large number of developmental processes that require vitamin A emerged first from nutritional deficiency studies in rat embryos, and later from genetic studies in mice. It is now generally believed that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is the form of vitamin A that supports both male and female reproduction as well as embryonic development. This conclusion is based on the ability to reverse most reproductive and developmental blocks found in vitamin A deficiency induced either by nutritional or genetic means with RA, and the ability to recapitulate the majority of embryonic defects in retinoic acid receptor compound null mutants. The activity of the catabolic CYP26 enzymes in determining what tissues have access to RA has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism, and helps to explain why exogenous RA can rescue many vitamin A deficiency defects. In severely vitamin A-deficient (VAD) female rats, reproduction fails prior to implantation, whereas in VAD pregnant rats given small amounts of carotene or supported on limiting quantities of RA early in organogenesis, embryos form but show a collection of defects called the vitamin A deficiency syndrome or late vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is also essential for the maintenance of the male genital tract and spermatogenesis. Recent studies show that vitamin A participates in a signaling mechanism to initiate meiosis in the female gonad during embryogenesis, and in the male gonad postnatally. Both nutritional and genetic approaches are being used to elucidate the vitamin A-dependent pathways upon which these processes depend.
Human six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 4 (STEAP4) is one of the STEAP family as a homologue of mouse tumour necrosis factor-α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP). Recently, we reported that the TIARP gene expression was remarkably increased in spleen and joints of glucose-6-phosphate isomerise (GPI)-induced arthritis model, suggesting pivotal association to arthritis. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression, localisation and function of STEAP4 in peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Peripheral blood was obtained from seven patients with RA, the surface expression of STEAP4 was detected by flow cytometry. The number of neutrophils was compared with the expression of STEAP4 mRNA derived from peripheral blood of patients with RA. Neutrophils were introduced by HL60 with retinoic acid, and were transfected with GFP-STEAP4 plasmid DNA, then the migration of neutrophil-like HL60 was determined by transwell assay. In addition, the fluctuation of STEAP4 mRNA was analysed before and after treatment with infliximab in 40 patients with RA.
STEAP4 was expressed on monocytes and neutrophils in peripheral blood in RA. The number of neutrophils and expression of STEAP4 mRNA was positively correlated. Migration of neutrophil-like HL60 was down-regulated by over-expression of STEAP4. Expression of STEAP4 Mrna was significantly decreased after infliximab treatment in patients with RA, especially in good responders.
STEAP4 is expressed on monocytes and neutrophils in peripheral blood, regulates cell migration, is down-regulated by TNF antagonist, and might be a possible predictor of response to TNF antagonist.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by cytokines induce the expression of inflammatory mediators in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) exerts an antiinflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms underlying interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) expression through ROS generation as modulated by HO-1 in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs).
IL-1β-induced ROS generation was determined by flow cytometry. The involvement of MAPKs and NADPH oxidase (NOX)/ROS in IL-1β-induced cPLA2 expression was investigated using pharmacologic inhibitors and transfection with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and was analyzed by Western blotting and promoter assay. Overexpression of HO-1 was performed by transfection of RASFs with a recombinant adenovirus containing human HO-1 plasmid. SCID mice with inflammation caused by IL-1β were infected with adenovirus containing HO-1. Histologic characterization of joint inflammation and local expression of cPLA2 were evaluated after treatment.
IL-1β-induced cPLA2 expression was mediated through NOX activation/ROS production, which was attenuated by N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a scavenger of ROS), the inhibitors of NOX (diphenyleneiodonium chloride and apocynin), MEK-1/2 (U0126), and JNK-1/2 (SP600125), transfection with the respective siRNAs, and the overexpression of HO-1 in RASFs. IL-1β-induced cPLA2 expression was mediated through recruitment of activator protein 1 (AP-1) to the cPLA2 promoter region, which was attenuated by NAC and overexpression of HO-1. Furthermore, HO-1 overexpression inhibited IL-1β-mediated cPLA2 expression in SCID mice.
In RASFs, IL-1β induced cPLA2 expression via activation of p42/p44 MAPK and JNK-1/2, leading to p47phox phosphorylation, ROS production, and AP-1 activation. The induction of HO-1 exerted protective effects on the pathogenesis of RA.
Translational animal models are essential in the prediction of the efficacy and side effects of new chemical entities. We have carried out a thorough study of three distinct disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in the rat and critically appraised the results in the context of the reported clinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Teriflunomide - a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor; AL8697 - a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor; and tofacitinib - a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor; were selected as representatives of their class and dose-response studies carried out using a therapeutic 10-day administration scheme in arthritic rats. Paw swelling and body weight were periodically monitored, and joint radiology and histology, lymph organ weight and haematological and biochemical parameters evaluated at study completion.
All three drugs demonstrated beneficial effects on paw swelling, bone lesions and splenomegalia, with p38 inhibition providing the best anti-inflammatory effect and JAK inhibition the best DMARD effect. Leukopenia, body weight loss and gastrointestinal toxicity were dose-dependently observed with teriflunomide treatment. p38 MAPK inhibition induced leukocytosis and increased total plasma cholesterol. JAK inhibition, normalized platelet, reticulocyte and neutrophil counts, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels while inducing lymphopenia and cholesterolemia.
This multiparametric approach can reveal specific drug properties and provide translational information. Whereas the complex profile for p38 inhibition in AIA is not observed in human RA, immunosuppressants such as DHODH and JAK inhibitors show DMARD properties and side effects seen in both AIA and RA.
Glucocorticoids (steroids) have been widely used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since Hench had attempted to administer cortisone (Kendall's compound E) to an active RA patient in 1948. Rheumatologists even in the 21st century can learn a lot from the history of steroid. In this feature article on steroid, a brief outline of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, a tissue-specific regulator of steroid response, is presented. The isozyme re-activates inactive cortisone (compound E) to active cortisol (compound F), and seems to play an important role particularly in adipose tissue. In addition, I give an account of non-genomic mechanisms of steroid, which might be relevant to early and rapid effects during methylprednisolone pulse therapy. As for the field of practical rheumatology, rates and dosages of steroid administration for RA in Japan are shown, by looking into 3 large observational cohort researches and post-marketing surveillance programs for several biologics. The definition or an appropriate interpretation of medical/technical terms such as 'effectiveness' in the clinical setting and 'low-dose' steroid is also described.
Utilization of endogenous adult spinal cord progenitor cells (SCPCs) for neuronal regeneration is a promising strategy for spinal cord repair. To mobilize endogenous SCPCs for injury repair, it is necessary to understand their intrinsic properties and to identify signaling factors that can stimulate their neurogenic potential. In this study, we demonstrate that adult mouse SCPCs express distinct combinatorial Hox genes and exhibit axial-specific stem cell properties. Lumbar-derived neurospheres displayed higher primary sphere formation and greater neurogenicity compared with cervical- and thoracic-derived neurospheres. To further understand the mechanisms governing neuronal differentiation of SCPCs from specific axial regions, we examined the neurogenic responses of adult SCPCs to retinoic acid (RA), an essential factor for adult neurogenesis. Although RA is a potent inducer of neuronal differentiation, we found that RA enhanced the generation of neurons specifically in cervical- but not lumbar-derived cells. We further demonstrate that the differential RA response was mediated by the RA-degrading enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidase b1 Cyp26b1. Lumbar cells express high levels of Cyp26b1 and low levels of the RA-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase Raldh2, resulting in limited activation of the RA signaling pathway in these cells. In contrast, low Cyp26b1 expression in cervical spinal cord progenitor cells allows RA signaling to be readily activated upon RA treatment. The intrinsic heterogeneity and signaling factor regulation among adult SCPCs suggest that different niche factor regimens are required for site-specific mobilization of endogenous SCPCs from distinct spatial regions of the spinal cord for injury repair.
WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX), a putative tumour suppressor, is suggested to be involved in the hyperphosphorylation of Alzheimer's Tau. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that has an important role in microtubule assembly and stability. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) has a vital role in Tau hyperphosphorylation at its microtubule-binding domains. Hyperphosphorylated Tau has a low affinity for microtubules, thus disrupting microtubule stability. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that WWOX contains two potential GSK3β-binding FXXXLI/VXRLE motifs. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation and molecular modelling showed that WWOX interacts physically with GSK3β. We demonstrated biochemically that WWOX can bind directly to GSK3β through its short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase domain. Moreover, the overexpression of WWOX inhibited GSK3β-stimulated S396 and S404 phosphorylation within the microtubule domains of Tau, indicating that WWOX is involved in regulating GSK3β activity in cells. WWOX repressed GSK3β activity, restored the microtubule assembly activity of Tau and promoted neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of WWOX in retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells inhibited neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that WWOX is likely to be involved in regulating GSK3β activity, reducing the level of phosphorylated Tau, and subsequently promoting neurite outgrowth during neuron differentiation. In summary, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which WWOX promotes neuronal differentiation in response to RA.
Cyp26A1 is a major enzyme that controls retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis by metabolizing RA into bio-inactive metabolites. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish cyp26a1 promoter possesses two conserved RA response elements (RAREs; proximal R1 and distal R2) in response to RA. Here, we report that it contains a novel RARE (R3) lying between R1 and R2. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that R3 works together with R1 and R2 to ensure the maximum RA inducibility of cyp26a1 promoter. Performing electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that RA receptor alpha can bind the novel RARE. Creating and analyzing transgenic zebrafish of Tg(cyp26a1-R3mut:eYFP)nju3/+ that harbor enhanced yellow fluorescent protein reporter gene (eYFP) driven by cyp26a1 promoter with mutated R3, we demonstrate that the reporter is mainly expressed in tissues of endogenous RA independent but not regions of RA dependent. Like Tg(cyp26a1:eYFP)nju1/+, which harbor eYFP driven by wild-type cyp26a1 promoter, the reporter in Tg(cyp26a1-R3mut:eYFP)nju3/+ responds to excessive RA dose dependently. However, it is expressed in a significantly lower level than the reporter in Tg(cyp26a1:eYFP)nju1/+ in response to exogenous RA. Taken together, our results demonstrate that zebrafish cyp26a1 promoter contains a novel RARE that plays crucial roles in regulating cyp26a1 expression during early development of zebrafish.
The progress of molecular genetics has enabled us to identify the genes responsible for congenital heart malformations. However, recent studies suggest that congenital heart diseases are induced not only by mutations in certain genes, but also by abnormal maternal factors. A high concentration of maternal retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A, is well known as a teratogenic agent that can cause developmental defects. Our previous studies have shown that the maternal administration of RA to mice within a narrow developmental window induces outflow tract (OFT) septum defects, a condition that closely resembles human transposition of the great arteries (TGA), although the responsible factors and pathogenic mechanisms of the TGA induced by RA remain unknown. We herein demonstrate that the expression of Tbx2 in the OFT myocardium is responsive to RA, and its downregulation is associated with abnormal OFT development. We found that RA could directly downregulate the Tbx2 expression through a functional retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the Tbx2 promoter region, which is also required for the initiation of Tbx2 transcription during OFT development. Tgfb2 expression was also downregulated in the RA-treated OFT region and was upregulated by Tbx2 in a culture system. Moreover, defective epithelial-mesenchymal transition caused by the excess RA was rescued by the addition of Tgfβ2 in an organ culture system. These data suggest that RA signaling participates in the Tbx2 transcriptional mechanism during OFT development and that the Tbx2-Tgfβ2 cascade is one of the key pathways involved in inducing the TGA phenotype.
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is associated with increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis. CYP26A1, the gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme specifically involved in metabolic inactivation of retinoic acid (RA), the most active vitamin A derivative, has been shown to result in a state of functional VAD of the cell. Recently, we demonstrated that CYP26A1 efficiently promotes cell survival properties and eventually contributes to the carcinogenic process, implying roles as an oncogene. To clarify the possible association between VAD caused by CYP26A1 expression and the development of human epithelial neoplasia, we examined whether enhanced expression of CYP26A1 might be observed in various lesions of human skin. We report here that basal keratinocytes showed only weak positivity of CYP26A1 in sunlight-nonexposed areas, whereas strong positive staining was observed in skin from chronically sunexposed body areas and in epidermis that had the dysplastic changes known as actinic keratosis. However, we found no expression of constitutive CYP26A1 in skin malignancies such as squamous cell carcinomas. Our observation suggests an involvement of enhanced CYP26A1 expression causing a functional VAD state in skin that can potentially lead to neoplastic transformation of keratinocytes in an early phase during skin carcinogenesis.
Proliferating pannus is in many aspects similar to placental tissue. Both fibroblast-rich tissues have high vascularity, and tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis (OA) demonstrates conversion of androgenic prehormones to downstream estrogens. We undertook this study to investigate similarities between proliferating pannus and placental tissue by focusing on angiogenic placenta growth factor 1 (PlGF-1) in patients with OA and patients with RA.
We used immunohistochemistry to study the presence of PlGF-1, its synovial distribution, and the PlGF-1-expressing synovial cell type. The relationship between PlGF-1 and conversion of the biologically inactive placental prehormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to the biologically active dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was investigated in mixed synovial cells. The effects of DHEA on PlGF-1 expression were studied by intracellular fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.
PlGF-1-positive cells were detected in the lining and sublining areas in patients with RA and patients with OA, and cellular density was similar. Double staining revealed that PlGF-1-positive cells were macrophages. In RA and OA, the density of PlGF-1-positive cells correlated positively with the density of macrophages and the density of type IV collagen-positive vessels. The supernatant concentration of (3) H-DHEA after conversion from (3) H-DHEAS and the density of aromatase-positive cells were positively correlated with the density of PlGF-1-positive cells only in OA. Low DHEA concentrations (≤10(-9) M) had stimulatory effects on PlGF-1 when compared to serum concentrations (10(-8) M to 10(-7) M) in the monocytic cell line THP-1 and in primary mixed synovial cells.
PlGF-1 functions similarly in inflamed synovium and in the placenta. It is related to vessel formation and, in OA patients, to androgen/estrogen conversion. Evolutionarily conserved functions of PlGF-1 for placental phenomena are obviously also present in synovial inflammation.
Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is necessary for proper patterning and morphogenesis during embryonic development. Tissue-specific RA signaling requires precise spatial and temporal synthesis of RA from retinal by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Raldh) and the conversion of retinol to retinal by retinol dehydrogenases (Rdh) of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reducatase gene family (SDR). The SDR, retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10), is a major contributor to retinal biosynthesis during mid-gestation. We have identified a missense mutation in the Rdh10 gene (Rdh10(m366Asp) ) using an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced forward genetic screen that result in reduced RA levels and signaling during embryonic development. Rdh10(m366Asp) mutant embryos have unique phenotypes, such as edema, a massive midline facial cleft, and neurogenesis defects in the forebrain, that will allow the identification of novel RA functions.
Medulloblastoma cells exhibit varied responses to therapy by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The underlying mechanism for such diverse effects however remains largely unclear. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the molecular basis of RA resistance through the study of RA signaling components in both RA-sensitive (Med-3) and RA-resistant (UW228-2 and UW228-3) medulloblastoma cells. The results revealed that RARα/β/γ and RXRα/β/γ were found in the three cell lines. Expression of CRABP-I and CRABP-II was seen in Med-3 cells, up-regulated when treated with RA, but was absent in UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells regardless of RA treatment. Bisulfite sequencing revealed 8 methylated CG sites at the promoter region of CRABP-II in UW228-2 and UW228-3 but not in Med-3 cells. Demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine recovered CRABP-II expression. Upon restoration of CRABP-II expression, both UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells responded to RA treatment by forming neuronal-like differentiation, synaptophysin expression, β-III tubulin upregulation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, CRABP-II specific siRNA reduced RA sensitivity in Med-3 cells. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining showed variable CRABP-II expression patterns among 104 medulloblastoma cases, ranging from negative (42.3%), partly positive (14.4%) to positive (43.3%). CRABP-II expression was positively correlated with synaptophysin (rs = 0.317; p = 0.001) but not with CRABP-I expression (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, aberrant methylation in CRABP-II reduces the expression of CRABP-II that in turn confers RA resistance in medulloblastoma cells. Determination of CRABP-II expression or methylation status may enable a personalized RA therapy in patients with medulloblastomas and other types of cancers.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) shares some risk genes with other disorders hallmarked by an autoimmune pathogenesis, most notably IL2RA and CLEC16A. We analyzed 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine risk genes, which recently emerged from a series of non-MS genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in a Spanish cohort comprising 2895 MS patients and 2942 controls. We identified two SNPs associated with MS. The first SNP, rs6859219, located in ANKRD55 (Chr5), was recently discovered in a meta-analysis of GWAS on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and emerged from this study with genome-wide significance (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35; P = 2.3 × 10(-9)). The second SNP, rs12785878, is located near DHCR7 (Chr11), a genetic determinant of vitamin D insufficiency, and showed a size effect in MS similar to that recently observed in Type 1 diabetes (T1D; OR = 1.10; P = 0.009). ANKRD55 is a gene of unknown function, and is flanked proximally by the IL6ST-IL31RA gene cluster. However, rs6859219 did not show correlation with a series of haplotype-tagging SNPs covering IL6ST-IL31RA, analyzed in a subset of our dataset (D'&lt; 0.31; r(2)&lt; 0.011). Our results expand the number of risk genes shared between MS, RA and T1D.
Retinoic acid (RA) plays pivotal roles in organogenesis, and both excessive and reduced amounts of RA cause developmental abnormalities. Reproductive organs are susceptible to teratogen toxigenicity, and the genital tubercle (GT) is one such representative organ. The physiological function of endogenous RA signaling and the mechanisms of RA-induced teratogenicity are poorly understood during the GT development. The objective of this study is to understand the developmental and teratogenic roles of RA during GT development by analyzing genetically modified mouse models. We found dynamic patterns of gene expression for the RA-synthesizing enzyme, Raldh2, and for the RA-catabolizing enzyme, Cyp26b1, during GT development. Rarb, an indicator gene for RA signaling, starts its expression in the prospective corpus cavernosum penis and in the urethral plate epithelium (UE), which plays central roles during GT development. Excessive RA signaling in Cyp26b1(-/-) mutants leads to abnormal extents of cell proliferation and differentiation during GT development, and also upregulates expression of growth factor signalings. They include Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling, which are expressed in the UE and its bilateral mesenchyme. RA signaling positively regulatesShh and Bmp4 expression during GT development as testified also by the experiment of RA administration and analyses of loss-of-function of RA signaling mutants. Thus, RA signaling is involved in the developmental cascade necessary for UE formation and GT development. 
Reducing inflammation and osteoclastogenesis by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) induction could be beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the function of HO-1 in bone metabolism remains unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of HO-1 and its repressor Bach1 in osteoclastogenesis.
In vitro osteoclastogenesis was compared in Bach1-deficient and wild-type mice. Osteoclasts (OCs) were generated from bone marrow-derived macrophages by stimulation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and expression of OC-related genes. Intracellular signal pathways in OC precursors were also assessed. HO-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was transduced into Bach1(-/-)  mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages to examine the role of HO-1 in osteoclastogenesis. In vivo inflammatory bone loss was evaluated by local injection of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) into calvaria.
Transcription of HO-1 was down-regulated by stimulation with RANKL in the early stage of OC differentiation. Bach1(-/-)  mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were partially resistant to the RANKL-dependent HO-1 reduction and showed impaired osteoclastogenesis, which was associated with reduced expression of RANK and components of the downstream TNF receptor-associated factor 6/c-Fos/NF-ATc1 pathway as well as reduced expression of Blimp1. Treatment with HO-1 shRNA increased the number of OCs and expression of OC-related genes except for the Blimp1 gene during in vitro osteoclastogenesis from Bach1(-/-)  mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. TNFα-induced bone destruction was reduced in Bach1(-/-)  mice in vivo.
The present findings demonstrate that Bach1 regulates osteoclastogenesis under inflammatory conditions, via both HO-1-dependent and HO-1-independent mechanisms. Bach1 may be worthy of consideration as a target for treatment of inflammatory bone loss in diseases including RA.
A cross-sectional study with comparison group.
To examine the effect of rugby training on the blood antioxidant capacity in able-bodied and wheelchair rugby players with tetraplegia.
Poland.
Four groups of subjects participated in the study: sedentary able-bodied males (group SA, n=19), sedentary males with tetraplegia (group ST, n=10), able-bodied rugby players (group RA, n=22) and wheelchair rugby players with tetraplegia (group RT, n=14). The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT) were determined in erythrocyte hemolysates, whereas glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was determined in whole-blood hemolysates. Concentrations of total antioxidant status (TAS) was determined in plasma.
SOD activity was significantly higher in the group SA compared with group ST and group RA. No significant differences occurred within the tetraplegic groups: RT and ST. Resting CAT and GPX activities were significantly higher in both the groups of rugby players than in the respective group of sedentary males. There were no differences in GR activity among all the studied groups. Plasma TAS concentration was higher in both the groups of able-bodied males compared with the respective groups of tetraplegics. The present study is the first to conduct an evaluation of wheelchair rugby training-induced adaptations to oxidative stress in individuals with tetraplegia.
Adaptive response to training was similar in both able-bodied and wheelchair rugby players, and it was characterized by increased erythrocyte CAT and GPX activities in resting conditions improving resistance to oxidative stress.
A transgenic mouse line harbouring a β-galacdosidase reporter gene controlled by the proximal 2 kb promoter of Hoxa3 was previously generated to investigate the regulatory cues governing Hoxa3 expression in the mouse. Examination of transgenic embryos from embryonic day (E) 8.0 to E15.5 revealed regionally restricted reporter activity in the developing heart. Indeed, transgene expression specifically delineated cells from three distinct lineages: a subpopulation of the second heart field contributing to outflow tract myocardium, the cardiac neural crest cells and the pharyngeal endoderm. Manipulation of the Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling pathway showed that RA is required for correct expression of the transgene. Therefore, this transgenic line may serve as a cardiosensor line of particular interest for further analysis of outflow tract development.
Gut-activated T cells migrating into the liver can cause extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. T cells acquire a gut-homing phenotype dependent on retinoic acid (RA) provided by intestinal dendritic cells (DC). We investigated whether liver antigen-presenting cells can induce gut tropism supporting an enterohepatic lymphocyte circulation. Priming of CD4(+) T cells by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) supported migration into gut and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. As observed for T cells primed by intestinal DCs, this gut tropism depended on α(4) β(7) integrin and CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) expression by LSEC-primed CD4(+) T cells. The induction of gut-homing molecules was mediated by RA, a derivate of vitamin A that is stored in large amounts within the liver. LSECs expressed functional retinal dehydrogenases and could convert vitamin A to RA. Conversely, the lack of signaling via the RA receptor prevented the expression of α(4) β(7) integrin and CCR9 on LSEC-primed CD4(+) T cells, consequently reducing their in vivo migration to the intestine. Other liver antigen-presenting cells failed to support high expression of α(4) β(7) integrin on CD4(+) T cells, thus, the potential to induce gut homing is restricted to LSECs.
The capacity to promote gut tropism via vitamin A use is not unique for intestinal DCs but is also a feature of LSECs. Our data support the assumption that CD4(+) T cells can migrate from the liver to the gut as one branch of a postulated enterohepatic lymphocyte circulation.
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in the metabolic and cellular transport pathway of methotrexate (MTX) on the clinical outcome of MTX monotherapy in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Fifty-five patients were treated with MTX monotherapy at a dose of 4-10 mg/week. The total concentration of MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) was measured at steady-state in red blood cells (RBCs) by high performance liquid chromatography. The genotype at 16 polymorphic sites in 11 genes (ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC2, RFC1, PCFT, SLCO1B1, MTHFR, GGH, ATIC, MTR, and MTRR) was analyzed. No significant association between the total concentration of MTX-PGs in RBCs and clinical outcome was found. However, patients with the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had a significantly lower mean disease activity score (DAS) 28 than did patients with the ABCB1 3435CC genotype (p = 0.02). Similarly, patients with the ABCB1 2677AA/AT/TT genotypes had a significantly lower mean DAS28 than did patients with the ABCB1 2677GG/GA/GT genotypes (p = 0.04). The patients with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype had a significantly lower mean DAS28 than those with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes (p = 0.04). In conclusion, the ABCB1 3435C&gt;T, ABCB1 2677G&gt;A/T, and MTHFR 1298A&gt;C polymorphisms influenced the efficacy of MTX monotherapy.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is initiated and maintained by various inflammatory/immune cells and their cytokines, leading to cartilage degradation and bone erosion. Despite its potent therapeutic efficacy on RA, the oral administration of methotrexate (MTX) provokes serious adverse systemic complications, thus necessitating the local application of MTX. Here, we show that transcutaneous MTX (TC-MTX) can efficiently penetrate joint skin ex vivo and in vivo, and that TC-MTX can significantly improve the various inflammatory symptoms associated with RA. Further, TC-MTX preserved the joint-structures in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which was also confirmed by three-dimensional micro-computed tomography scan. TC-MTX markedly decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines both in the serum and in inflamed joints of CIA mice. Further, its therapeutic potential is comparable to that of etanercept, a biological agent that block tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Importantly, the systemic cytotoxicity of TC-MTX was not detected. Thus, TC-MTX can be a new therapeutic modality for RA patients without systemic complications.
Vitamin A and its analogs (retinoids) regulate adipocyte differentiation. Recent investigations have demonstrated a relationship among retinoids, retinoid-binding-protein 4 (RBP4) synthesized in adipose tissues, and insulin-resistance status. In this study, we measured retinoid levels and analyzed the expression of retinoid homeostatic genes associated with retinol uptake, esterification, oxidation, and catabolism in subcutaneous (Sc) and visceral (Vis) mouse fat tissues. Both Sc and Vis depots were found to contain similar levels of all-trans retinol. A metabolite of retinol with characteristic ultraviolet absorption maxima for 9-cis retinol was observed in these 2 adipose depots, and its level was 2-fold higher in Sc than in Vis tissues. Vis adipose tissue expressed significantly higher levels of RBP4, CRBP1 (intracellular retinol-binding protein 1), RDH10 (retinol dehydrogenase), as well as CYP26A1 and B1 (retinoic acid (RA) hydroxylases). No differences in STRA6 (RBP4 receptor), LRAT (retinol esterification), CRABP1 and 2 (intracellular RA-binding proteins), and RALDH1 (retinal dehydrogenase) mRNA expressions were discerned in both fat depots. RALDH1 was identified as the only RALDH expressed in both Sc and Vis adipose tissues. These results indicate that Vis is more actively involved in retinoid metabolism than Sc adipose tissue.
The requirement for vitamin A in reproduction and development was first determined from studies of nutritional deficiencies. Subsequent research has shown that embryonic development and both male and female reproduction are modulated by retinoic acid (RA), the active form of vitamin A. Because RA is active in multiple developmental systems, its synthesis, transport, and degradation are tightly regulated in different tissues. A growing body of evidence implicates RA as a requirement for the initiation of meiosis in both male and female mammals, resulting in a mechanistic model involving the interplay of RA, RA synthesis enzymes, RA receptors, and degradative cytochrome P450 enzymes in this system. Recently, that model has been challenged, prompting a review of the established paradigm. While it remains possible that additional molecules may be involved in regulating entry into meiosis, the weight of evidence supporting a key role for RA is incontrovertible.
Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. However, 30% of RA patients discontinue therapy within 1 year, usually because of adverse effects. Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the association of polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene with the toxicity of MTX in RA. The aim of this study was to assess the involvement of the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene in the toxicity of MTX in a Spanish RA population.
The study included retrospectively 468 Spanish RA patients treated with MTX. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using the oligonucleotide microarray technique. Allele and genotype association analyses with regard to MTX toxicity and a haplotype association test were also performed.
Eighty-four out of the 468 patients (18%) had to discontinue therapy due to adverse effects or MTX toxicity. The C677T polymorphism (rs1801133) was associated with increased MTX toxicity [odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.98, p = 0.0428], and the strongest association was shown in the recessive model (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.08-3.53, p = 0.0246). The A1298C polymorphism (rs1801131) was not associated with increased MTX toxicity (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65-1.38, p = 0.761). A borderline significant risk haplotype was found: 677T-1298A (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.96, p = 0.0518).
These results demonstrate that the C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene is associated with MTX toxicity in a Spanish RA population.
To identify and evaluate potentially useful biomarkers for oxidative stress as early warning indices in the polychaete, Perinereis nuntia, we exposed P. nuntia to copper (Cu) and measured several biomarker enzymes (glutathione S-transferase; GST, glutathione peroxidase; GPx, Metallothionein-like protein; MTLPs, and catalase; CAT) and genes (Pn-GSTs, Pn-CAT, and Pn-MT) with a cellular oxidative index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Accumulated Cu concentrations in P. nuntia increased in a time-dependent manner. Intracellular ROS reached high levels 6h after exposure in P. nuntia with an increase of GST activity and glutathione (GSH) content. Particularly, GSH in polychaetes showed a positive correlation with Cu contents accumulated in P. nuntia. Messenger RNA expressions of GST sigma and GST omega showed relatively high expressions at 50 μg/L of Cu exposure, even though the moderate increase of rest of GST isoforms was also observed. Also regarding long-term exposure, we reared P. nuntia in sediments for 15 days, and found that there was an obvious increase of Pn-GSTs, Pn-CAT, and Pn-MT genes with elevated concentrations of Cu and Cd in polychaete body, compared to initial levels, suggesting that P. nuntia in sediment was affected by metals as well as by other organic pollutants to induce oxidative stress genes and enzymes. These findings suggest that oxidative stress is a potential modulator of defense system of P. nuntia. Several potential biomarker genes are available as early warning signals for environmental biomonitoring.
We tested the hypothesis that heart failure (HF) results in right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) denervation that contributes to sinoatrial node dysfunction.
HF is associated with sinoatrial node dysfunction. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear.
We recorded nerve activity (NA) from the RAGP, right stellate ganglion (SG), and right vagal nerve in 7 ambulatory dogs at baseline and after pacing-induced HF. We also determined the effects of RAGP stimulation in isolated normal and HF canine RA.
NAs in both the SG and vagal were significantly higher in HF than at baseline. The relationship between 1-minute integrated NAs of vagal and RAGP showed either a positive linear correlation (Group 1, n = 4) or an L-shaped correlation (Group 2, n = 3). In all dogs, a reduced heart rate was observed when vagal-NA was associated with simultaneously increased RAGP-NA. On the other hand, when vagal-NA was not associated with increased RAGP-NA, the heart rate was not reduced. The induction of HF significantly decreased RAGP-NA in all dogs (P &lt; 0.05). Stimulating the superior RAGP in isolated RA significantly reduced the sinus rate in normal but not the HF hearts. Immunohistochemical staining revealed lower densities of tyrosine hydroxylase- and choline acetyltransferase-positive nerve tissues in HF RAGP than normal (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).
The RAGP-NA is essential for the vagal nerve to counterbalance the SG in sinus rate control. In HF, RAGP denervation and decreased RAGP-NA contribute to the sinus node dysfunction.
All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is an important signaling molecule in all chordates. The cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP26 are believed to partially regulate cellular concentrations of atRA via oxidative metabolism and hence affect retinoid homeostasis and signaling. CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 are atRA hydroxylases that catalyze formation of similar metabolites in cell systems. However, they have only 40% sequence similarity suggesting differences between the two enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 have similar catalytic activity, form different metabolites from atRA and are expressed in different tissues in adults. The mRNA expression of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 correlated between human tissues except for human cerebellum in which CYP26B1 was the predominant CYP26 and liver in which CYP26A1 dominated. Quantification of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 protein in human tissues was in agreement with the mRNA expression and showed correlation between the two isoforms. Qualitatively, recombinant CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 formed the same primary and sequential metabolites from atRA. Quantitatively, CYP26B1 had a lower K(m) (19nM) and V(max) (0.8 pmol/min/pmol) than CYP26A1 (K(m)=50 nM and V(max)=10 pmol/min/pmol) for formation of 4-OH-RA. The major atRA metabolites 4-OH-RA, 18-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA were all substrates of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, and CYP26A1 had a 2-10-fold higher catalytic activity towards all substrates tested. This study shows that CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 are qualitatively similar RA hydroxylases with overlapping expression profiles. CYP26A1 has higher catalytic activity than CYP26B1 and seems to be responsible for metabolism of atRA in tissues that function as a barrier for atRA exposure.
Excess exogenous retinoic acid (RA) has been well documented to have teratogenic effects in the limb and craniofacial skeleton. Malformations that have been observed in this context include craniosynostosis, a common developmental defect of the skull that occurs in 1 in 2500 individuals and results from premature fusion of the cranial sutures. Despite these observations, a physiological role for RA during suture formation has not been demonstrated. Here, we present evidence that genetically based alterations in RA signaling interfere with human development. We have identified human null and hypomorphic mutations in the gene encoding the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 that lead to skeletal and craniofacial anomalies, including fusions of long bones, calvarial bone hypoplasia, and craniosynostosis. Analyses of murine embryos exposed to a chemical inhibitor of Cyp26 enzymes and zebrafish lines with mutations in cyp26b1 suggest that the endochondral bone fusions are due to unrestricted chondrogenesis at the presumptive sites of joint formation within cartilaginous templates, whereas craniosynostosis is induced by a defect in osteoblastic differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis, in situ expression studies, and in vitro quantitative RT-PCR experiments of cellular markers of osseous differentiation indicate that the most likely cause for these phenomena is aberrant osteoblast-osteocyte transitioning. This work reveals a physiological role for RA in partitioning skeletal elements and in the maintenance of cranial suture patency.
To determine whether soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is a useful biomarker to predict the response to adalimumab (ADA) in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients administrated ADA (n=51) were classified as good responders (n=18) or nonresponders (n=9) according to the EULAR response criteria after 8 weeks of bi-weekly ADA administration. We examined the expression of cytokines and chemokines in these groups by antibody array methods. Positive results obtained by antibody array methods were further confirmed by ELISA.
Antibody array has identified that the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) decreased in the good responders to ADA whereas these changes were not observed in the non-responders. The decrement of serum uPAR was confirmed by ELISA in the good responders to ADA. Furthermore, serum uPAR at baseline was significantly high in non-responders compared with good responders.
An antibody array is convenient for screening the expression of proteins of interest. Examination of serum uPAR at baseline and thereafter may be useful as a predictive biomarker for primary failure toward ADA in patients with RA.
To clarify the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by comparing protein expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with RA with that in FLS from normal subjects, using proteomics analysis.
Proteins extracted from primary cultures of FLS obtained from 50 patients with RA and 10 normal subjects were analyzed by automated 2-dimensional nano-electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry. Differentially expressed proteins were screened by 2-sample t-test (P &lt; 0.05) and fold change (&gt;1.5), based on the bioinformatics analysis. The expression of vasculature development-related proteins (Thy-1, connective tissue growth factor [CTGF], and thrombospondin 1 [TSP-1]) and redox-related proteins (superoxide dismutase 2 [SOD2]) in synovial tissue was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The effect of Thy-1 and CTGF knockdown on Thy-1, CTGF, TSP-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was analyzed by RNA interference experiments.
According to the criteria of having &gt;1 unique peptide per protein present and a false discovery rate of ≤5%, 1,060 proteins were identified from patients with RA, and 1,292 proteins were identified from normal subjects, from which 100 differentially expressed proteins were screened out from the RA proteins. Of these, 46 proteins were up-regulated, and the remaining 54 proteins were down-regulated. Gene ontology and pathway analyses showed that 6 vasculature development-related proteins were up-regulated, including Thy-1, CTGF, and TSP-1, while 11 redox-related proteins were down-regulated, including SOD2. The results were consistent with those obtained using mass spectrometry. Thy-1, VEGF, CTGF, and TSP-1 were down-regulated after Thy-1 knockdown, and VEGF and CTGF were down-regulated after CTGF knockdown. Recombinant human CTGF could enhance proliferation and Transwell migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
Up-regulation of vasculature development-related proteins and down-regulation of redox-related proteins in FLS are predominant factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA.
The present work was undertaken to study the status and contribution of oxidative stress in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Relationship of the markers of oxidative stress to clinical manifestations, disease activity, damage and medications used were well considered.
Thirty SLE and 30 RA female patients were included in the study and clinical examination and investigations were performed and disease activity was assessed. Markers of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant scavengers with glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px) were assessed.
Level of MDA, GSH and GSH Px were remarkably altered in RA and SLE patients compared to controls. Markers of increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant capacity were profound in RA and significantly reflected disease activity in RA and SLE, with special attention to alopecia and lupus nephritis. RA patients receiving methotrexate had significantly altered parameters and the steroid dose in SLE patients correlated with these markers.
Oxidative stress was increased and more profound in RA than SLE and could well reflect disease activity, with special attention to SLE patients with alopecia and nephritis. Medications used are closely related to the oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. Considering antioxidants in novel therapeutic strategies is important in SLE and RA patients.
The zebrafish embryo is an important in vivo model to study the host innate immune response towards microbial infection. In most zebrafish infectious disease models, infection is achieved by micro-injection of bacteria into the embryo. Alternatively, Edwardsiella tarda, a natural fish pathogen, has been used to treat embryos by static immersion. In this study we used transcriptome profiling and quantitative RT-PCR to analyze the immune response induced by E. tarda immersion and injection.
Mortality rates after static immersion of embryos in E. tarda suspension varied between 25-75%, while intravenous injection of bacteria resulted in 100% mortality. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis on the level of single embryos showed that expression of the proinflammatory marker genes il1b and mmp9 was induced only in some embryos that were exposed to E. tarda in the immersion system, whereas intravenous injection of E. tarda led to il1b and mmp9 induction in all embryos. In addition, microarray expression profiles of embryos subjected to immersion or injection showed little overlap. E. tarda-injected embryos displayed strong induction of inflammatory and defense genes and of regulatory genes of the immune response. E. tarda-immersed embryos showed transient induction of the cytochrome P450 gene cyp1a. This gene was also induced after immersion in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspensions, but, in contrast, was not induced upon intravenous E. tarda injection. One of the rare common responses in the immersion and injection systems was induction of irg1l, a homolog of a murine immunoresponsive gene of unknown function.
Based on the differences in mortality rates between experiments and gene expression profiles of individual embryos we conclude that zebrafish embryos cannot be reproducibly infected by exposure to E. tarda in the immersion system. Induction of il1b and mmp9 was consistently observed in embryos that had been systemically infected by intravenous injection, while the early transcriptional induction of cyp1a and irg1l in the immersion system may reflect an epithelial or other tissue response towards cell membrane or other molecules that are shed or released by bacteria. Our microarray expression data provide a useful reference for future analysis of signal transduction pathways underlying the systemic innate immune response versus those underlying responses to external bacteria and secreted virulence factors and toxins.
Although the genetic component in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been consistently suggested, many novel genetic loci remain to uncover. To identify RA risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 100 RA cases and 600 controls using Affymetrix SNP array 5.0. The candidate risk locus (APOM gene) was re-sequenced to discover novel promoter and coding variants in a group of the subjects. Replication was performed with the independent case-control set comprising of 578 RAs and 711 controls. Through GWAS, we identified a novel SNP associated with RA at the APOM gene in the MHC class III region on 6p21.33 (rs805297, odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, P = 5.20 × 10-7). Three more polymorphisms were identified at the promoter region of the APOM by the re-sequencing. For the replication, we genotyped the four SNP loci in the independent case-control set. The association of rs805297 identified by GWAS was successfully replicated (OR = 1.40, P = 6.65 × 10-5). The association became more significant in the combined analysis of discovery and replication sets (OR = 1.56, P = 2.73 × 10-10). The individuals with the rs805297 risk allele (A) at the promoter region showed a significantly lower level of APOM expression compared with those with the protective allele (C) homozygote. In the logistic regressions by the phenotype status, the homozygote risk genotype (A/A) consistently showed higher ORs than the heterozygote one (A/C) for the phenotype-positive RAs. These results indicate that APOM promoter polymorphisms are significantly associated with the susceptibility to RA.
Cyp26b1, a retinoic acid (RA)-metabolising enzyme, is expressed in the developing limb bud, and Cyp26b1(-/-) mice present with severe limb defects. These malformations might be attributable to an RA-induced patterning defect; however, recent reports suggest that RA is dispensable for limb patterning. In this study, we examined the role of endogenous retinoid signalling in skeletogenesis using Cyp26b1(-/-) mice and transgenic mice in which Cyp26b1 is conditionally deleted under control of the Prrx1 promoter beginning at ~E9.5 (Prrx1Cre(+)/Cyp26b1(fl/fl)). We found that the limb phenotype in Prrx1Cre(+)/Cyp26b1(fl/fl) mice was less severe than that observed in Cyp26b1(-/-) animals and that a change in retinoid signalling contributed to the difference in phenotypes. We systematically examined the role of endogenous RA signalling in chondrogenesis and found that Cyp26b1(-/-) cells and limb mesenchymal cells treated with a CYP inhibitor, are maintained in a pre-chondrogenic state, exhibit reduced chondroblast differentiation and have modestly accelerated chondrocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, Cyp26b1(-/-) mesenchyme exhibited an increase in expression of genes in a closely related tendogenic lineage, indicating that retinoid signals in the limb interfere with differentiation and maintain progenitor status. Together, these findings support an important function for RA in regulating the behaviour of mesenchymal progenitors, and their subsequent differentiation and maturation.
Rosmarinic acid (RA), a caffeic acid ester, has insulin-sensitizing and antioxidant effects in high fructose-fed model of insulin resistance (IR). This study investigated whether RA supplementation prevents cardiac abnormalities and hypertension in fructose-fed rats (FFR). Rats fed with fructose diet (60 g/100 g) for 60 days exhibited metabolic abnormalities and rise in plasma and cardiac lipids and whole body IR. The levels of cardiac antioxidants and plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power were significantly reduced in FFR concomitant with increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products. A significant rise in troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase in plasma of FFR was noted. RA supplementation to FFR (10 mg/kg from the 16th day) significantly improved insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid levels, oxidative damage, and the expression of p22phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase, and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Fructose-induced rise in blood pressure was also lowered by RA through decrease in endothelin-1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and increase in nitric oxide levels. Histology revealed a reduction in myocardial damage in RA-supplemented FFR. These findings suggest that RA acts as a vasoactive substance and a cardioprotector through its antioxidant property. Thus, RA may be useful in reducing the cardiovascular risk associated with IR.
We investigated associations between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms C677T and A1298C and methotrexate (MTX)-related toxicities in Korean patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) taking MTX. One hundred sixty-seven patients with RA were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms C677T and A1298C in MTHFR. Alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were not associated with specific MTX toxicities. However, among RA patients with the 1298CC genotype, the proportion who experienced at least one toxicity was significantly greater than the proportion of patients with 1298AA who did (P = 0.043). In addition, the proportion of patients with the 677C/1298A haplotype who experienced toxicity was greater than the proportion of those with 677C/1298C who did (P = 0.032, odds ratio = 2.085, 95% confidence interval 1.058-4.106). In this study, MTHFR polymorphisms were associated with MTX toxicities in Korean patients with RA. Further study for association of MTHFR polymorphisms with MTX toxicities should be needed in larger RA population.
Sex determination in fetal germ cells depends on a balance between exposure to retinoic acid (RA) and the degradation of RA achieved by the testis-specific expression of the catabolic cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP26B1. Therefore, identification of factors regulating the expression of the Cyp26b1 gene is an important goal in reproductive biology. We used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that Cyp26b1 and transcription factor genes steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1) and Sry-related HMG box 9 (Sox9) are coexpressed in Sertoli cells, whereas Cyp26b1 and Sf1 are coexpressed in Leydig cells in mouse fetal testes. In the mouse gonadal somatic cell line TM3, transfection of constructs expressing SOX9 and SF1 activated Cyp26b1 expression, independently of the positive regulator RA. In embryonic gonads deficient in SOX9 or SF1, Cyp26b1 expression was decreased relative to wild-type (WT) controls, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, qRT-PCR showed that Cyp26b1 up-regulation by SOX9/SF1 was attenuated by the ovarian transcription factor Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) in TM3 cells, whereas in Foxl2-null mice, Cyp26b1 expression in XX gonads was increased ∼20-fold relative to WT controls. These data support the hypothesis that SOX9 and SF1 ensure the male fate of germ cells by up-regulating Cyp26b1 and that FOXL2 acts to antagonize Cyp26b1 expression in ovaries.
Isoniazid (INH), a key drug of antituberculosis therapy, is metabolized by arylamine N-acetyltransferase2 (NAT2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). We studied the possible influence of genetic polymorphisms of INH-metabolizing enzymes on serum concentrations of INH and its metabolites, as well as on the incidence of hepatotoxicity.
A total of 144 tuberculosis patients who received antituberculosis treatment were followed prospectively. Their NAT, CYP2E1 and GST genotypes were determined using a polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Blood samples were collected from the patients and serum concentrations were determined by HPLC. The severity of hepatotoxicity was judged by the increases in either aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels from the upper limit of the corresponding normal range.
Incidence of hepatotoxicity was highest in pulmonary tuberculosis patients with the slow acetylator (SA) phenotype and lowest in those with the rapid acetylator (RA) phenotype, although no clear relationship of genetic polymorphism of INH-metabolizing enzymes on the severity of hepatotoxicity were confirmed.
The risk of side-effects, such as hepatic disorder, may rise in these patients with an SA phenotype, because of an increase in serum INH concentration. The evidence presented in this study, albeit based on the examination of a low number of patients, suggests that a safe INH dosage for tuberculosis patients with SA phenotype should be less than the dosage which is usually recommended for tuberculosis patients.
Though, it is quite well-known how retinoic acid (RA) is able to induce neuritogenesis in different in vitro models, the putative role exerted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during this process still need to be further studied. For such purpose, we used a neuronal-like cell line (SH-SY5Y cells) in order to investigate whether the antioxidant Trolox (a hydrophilic analog of alpha-tocopherol) could have any effect on the number of RA-induced neurites, and how significant changes in cellular redox homeostasis may affect the cellular endogenous expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Our results show a significant enhancement of RA (10 μM)-induced neuritogenesis and TH endogenous expression, when cells were co-treated with Trolox (100 μM) for 7 days. Moreover, this effect was associated with an improvement in cellular viability. The mechanism seems to mainly involve PI3 K/Akt rather than MEK signaling pathway. Therefore, our data demonstrate that concomitant decreases in basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production could exert a positive effect on the neuritogenic process of RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells.
NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) is an important detoxification enzyme that can protect mammalian cells against toxic quinones and reduce the risk of tumorigenesis. In this study, it was found that salvianolic acid B (SaB), lithospermic acid (LA), and rosmarinic acid (RA), three main hydrophilic constituents in Danshen, conjugated with glutathione (GSH) easily in vitro but exhibited no NQO1-inducing activities in Hepa 1c1c7 cells, which might attribute to their poor absorptions. After a simple methylation strategy that aimed at improving the liposolubility, both the NQO1-inducing activities and the absorptions in cells of the phenolic acids improved obviously, without losing the GSH-conjugating abilities. The concentration to double the specific activity of NQ01 values of methylated products of lithospermic acid and rosmarinic acid were 17.86 ± 2.34 μg/mL and 11.97 ± 0.60 μg/mL, respectively. The findings indicated that methylation is an effective strategy to improve the NQO1-inducing activities of phenolic acids in Danshen.
The aim of this study was to investigate genetic variants in the gene neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1) for association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In rodent models, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Ncf1 has been shown to be a major locus regulating severity of arthritis. Ncf1 encodes one of five subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex. In humans the genomic structure of NCF1 is complex, excluding it from genome-wide association screens and complicating genetic analysis. In addition to copy number variation of NCF1, there are also two nonfunctional pseudogenes, nearly identical in sequence to NCF1. We have characterized copy number variation and SNPs in NCF1, and investigated these variants for association with RA.
We find that RA patients are less likely to have an increased copy number of NCF1, 7.6%, compared with 11.6% in controls; p=0.037. We also show that the T-allele of NCF1-339 (rs13447) is expressed in NCF1 and significantly reduces reactive oxygen species production.
This is the first finding of genetic association of NCF1 with RA. The detailed characterization of genetic variants in NCF1 also helps elucidate the complexity of the NCF1 gene.
These data suggest that an increased copy number of NCF1 can be protective against developing RA and add support to previous findings of a role of NCF1 and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex in RA pathogenesis.
Transient global cerebral ischemia (TGCI) occurs during acute severe hypotension depriving the brain of oxygen and glucose for a short period of time. During reperfusion, several mechanisms can induce secondary neuronal damage, including the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydrogen gas-enriched air inhalation is a neuroprotective approach with proven antioxidant potential, which has not yet been examined in TGCI. Accordingly, we set out to describe the effect of inhalation of 2.1% hydrogen supplemented room air (H(2)-RA) in comparison with a well studied neuroprotective agent, rosiglitazone (RSG) in a TGCI rat model. Male Wistar rats were exposed to TGCI (n=26) or sham operation (n=26), while a third group served as intact control (naive, n=5). The operated groups were further divided into non-treated, H(2)-RA, RSG (6 mg/kg i.v.) and vehicle treated animals. Tissue samples from the hippocampus and frontal cortex were taken 3 days following surgery. Western blot analysis was applied to determine the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and eNOS, respectively), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glial connexin proteins: connexin 30 and connexin 43. The expressions of COX-2, and connexin proteins were upregulated, while nNOS was downregulated 3 days after TGCI. Both RSG and H(2)-RA prevented the changes of enzyme and connexin levels. Considering the lack of harmful side effects, inhalation of H(2)-RA can be a promising approach to reduce neuronal damage after TGCI.
Leukotriene B4-12-hydroxydehydrogenase (LTB4DH) is characterized as a chemopreventive and tumor suppressor gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmaco-logical induction of LTB4DH and potential anticancer activity. Using HepG2 cells as a cellular detector, we successfully isolated the active compounds from the herbs Radix Astragali and Radix Paeoniae Rubra through a bioactivity-guided fractionation procedure. Using various analytical techniques including electronic spray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gallic acid (GA) was identified as the active compound from Radix Paeoniae Rubra whereas the active compound from Radix Astragali, designated as RA-C, was also purified to the extent that it is now suitable for further identifi-cation. We found that the active compounds from these two different herbs synergistically induced LTB4DH expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A key finding was that commercial GA in combination with purified RA-C attenuated the focus formation and anchorage-independent growth, two indexes of in vitro oncogenic transformation, of HepG2 cells via the induction of LTB4DH expression. Moreover, the combination of GA and purified RA-C significantly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells. Our results demon-strated for the first time that GA and purified RA-C suppress the in vitro oncogenic transformation of HepG2 cells via the induction of LTB4DH expression. Importantly, pharmaco-logical induction of LTB4DH represents a potential alternative strategy for the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hypoxia is a feature of the inflamed synovium in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Intra-articular injection of hyaluronan (HA) may be considered a potential way to treat RA. However, the exact molecular mechanism of HA on decreased cellular responses to hypoxic environment is unclear. The present study has been designed to use the adjuvant-induced arthritis model to examine the effects of HA on the changes of immunohistochemical expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in the synovial tissues at the early phase of arthritic inflammation.
Monoarthritis was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley (250-300 g) via intraarticular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the tibiotarsal joint. The CFA-induction arthritis animals were divided into three groups: treatment (intraarticular injection of HA), placebo (intraarticular injection of saline) and controls (no treatments). Functional evaluations of edema and pain behavior, histology, and HIF-1alpha, iNOS, and MMP3 immunohistochemistry were performed before, after the first injection, three injections, and on the follow-up injection of the treatments.
Intra-articular injection of HA also significantly suppressed the mechanical allodynia (p &lt; 0.001) and overexpressions of HIF-1alpha (p &lt; 0.001), iNOS (p = 0.004) and MMP3 (p &lt; 0.001) immunoreactivity in synovium.
This study demonstrated that early intervention of HA is an effective protection against accumulation of inflammation-induced HIF-1alpha, iNOS, and MMP3 to limit erosive damage in CFA-induced model of arthritis.
The development of mammalian fetal germ cells along oogenic or spermatogenic fate trajectories is dictated by signals from the surrounding gonadal environment. Germ cells in the fetal testis enter mitotic arrest, whilst those in the fetal ovary undergo sex-specific entry into meiosis, the initiation of which is thought to be mediated by selective exposure of fetal ovarian germ cells to mesonephros-derived retinoic acid (RA). Aspects of this model are hard to reconcile with the spatiotemporal pattern of germ cell differentiation in the human fetal ovary, however. We have therefore examined the expression of components of the RA synthesis, metabolism and signalling pathways, and their downstream effectors and inhibitors in germ cells around the time of the initiation of meiosis in the human fetal gonad. Expression of the three RA-synthesising enzymes, ALDH1A1, 2 and 3 in the fetal ovary and testis was equal to or greater than that in the mesonephros at 8-9 weeks gestation, indicating an intrinsic capacity within the gonad to synthesise RA. Using immunohistochemistry to detect RA receptors RARα, β and RXRα, we find germ cells to be the predominant target of RA signalling in the fetal human ovary, but also reveal widespread receptor nuclear localization indicative of signalling in the testis, suggesting that human fetal testicular germ cells are not efficiently shielded from RA by the action of the RA-metabolising enzyme CYP26B1. Consistent with this, expression of CYP26B1 was greater in the human fetal ovary than testis, although the sexually-dimorphic expression patterns of the germ cell-intrinsic regulators of meiotic initiation, STRA8 and NANOS2, appear conserved. Finally, we demonstrate that RA induces a two-fold increase in STRA8 expression in cultures of human fetal testis, but is not sufficient to cause widespread meiosis-associated gene expression. Together, these data indicate that while local production of RA within the fetal ovary may be important in regulating the onset of meiosis in the human fetal ovary, mechanisms other than CYP26B1-mediated metabolism of RA may exist to inhibit the entry of germ cells into meiosis in the human fetal testis.
Fugu (Takifugu rubripes) has contributed as an ideal model organism for understanding the structure and evolution of vertebrate genomes, but also has potential as a good model organism for developmental biology because of the availability of the genome information. However, there is no comprehensive report describing the developmental stages, which is fundamental data for developmental biology. Here we describe a series of stages of the embryonic development of fugu during the first 8 days after fertilization, i.e. from fertilization to hatching. We define seven periods of embryogenesis - the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. Stages subdividing these periods are defined based on morphological characteristics. In addition, as a model experiment of gene expression analysis using this staging series, we performed in situ hybridization of aldh1a2, aldh1a3 and cyp26a1 that play regulatory roles in retinoic acid (RA) metabolism essential for embryogenesis. This report provides fundamental information on fugu embryogenesis, which is anticipated to facilitate the use of fugu as a model organism for developmental studies.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of retained acupuncture (RA) in neurotoxin-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce the PD model. The mice were divided into four groups, namely, (1) normal; (2) MPTP+retained acupuncture (RA); (3) MPTP+electroacupuncture (EA); (4) MPTP+sham acupuncture (SA). After mice being manipulated with/without acupuncture at acupoints (Daling, PC 7), groups 2-4 were injected with MPTP (15 mg/kg/d). The mice were evaluated for behavioral changes, in terms of time of landing, after acupuncture treatment. The animals were sacrificed and their brains assayed for dopamine and its metabolites and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression by using HPLC and immunohistochemistry/Western blotting, respectively. [(123)I] IBZM-SPECT imaging between SA and RA groups were compared. The results showed that the time of landing of the three groups with treatment was significant longer than group 1 (normal) (4.33±0.15 s). Nonetheless, group 2 (RA) (7.13±0.20 s) had a shorter time of landing than group 4 (SA) (7.89±0.46 s). The number of TH (+) neurons and the expression of TH proteins were significantly higher in the RA group than in the SA/EA groups. RA also increased the uptake of [(123)I] IBZM into the triatum compared to the SA group. We conclude that RA possibly attenuates neuronal damage in MPTP-induced PD mice, which suggests RA may be useful as a complementary strategy when treating human PD.
Retinoic acid (RA) regulates key biological processes, including differentiation, apoptosis and cell survival. RA mediates induction of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 mRNA, catalyzing the conversion of estradiol to estrone, in endometrium but not endometriosis because of a defect in endometriotic stromal cells. This defect may involve both the uptake and metabolism of RA. In this study, we analyze the expression of genes involved in RA signaling in normal endometrium and endometriosis.
Tissue and stromal cells from ovarian endometriomas and eutopic endometrium from disease-free women were collected. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA levels. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression.
We found that endometriotic tissue and stromal cells demonstrated significantly decreased mRNA expression of the major genes involved in RA signaling, including STRA6, CRBP1, ALDH1A2, CRABP2 and FABP5. We found increased levels of CYP26B1, responsible for RA metabolism. Nuclear extracts showed that RARα, RXRα and PPARβ/δ were underexpressed in both tissues and stromal cells from endometriotic tissue. Differences in protein levels were confirmed by western blotting.
Endometriosis is characterized by a gene expression pattern suggesting a decrease in uptake and metabolism of RA. Because RA is integral in regulating key biological processes involved in cell survival, this alteration could partially explain the resistance to apoptosis found in endometriosis.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a key negative regulator of immune responses and has been implicated in tumor tolerance, autoimmune disease and asthma. IDO was detected in the joint synovial tissue in the inflammatory microenvironment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but IDO expression in joint synovial tissue is not sufficient to overcome the inflamed synovial environment. This study aimed to unravel the mechanisms involving the failure to activate tolerogenic IDO in the inflamed joint. We demonstrate that both poly (I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce expression of IDO in synovial fibroblasts. However, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-23 and IL-16 did not induce IDO expression. Poly (I:C) appeared to induce higher IDO expression than did LPS. Surprisingly, toll-like receptor (TLR)4-mediated IDO expression was upregulated after depletion of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) in synovial fibroblasts using small interfering RNA (siRNA). IDO, TLR3 and TLR4 were highly expressed in synovial tissue of RA patients compared with that of osteoarthritis patients. In addition, RA patients with severe disease activity had higher levels of expression of IDO, TLR3 and TLR4 in the synovium than patients with mild disease activity. These data suggest that upregulation of IDO expression in synovial fibroblasts involves TLR3 and TLR4 activation by microbial constituents. We showed that the mechanisms responsible for IDO regulation primarily involve MyD88 signaling in synovial fibroblasts, as demonstrated by siRNAmediated knockdown of MyD88.
This study investigated the sex differences in the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PGs) to flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Radial artery (RA) FMD, assessed as the dilatory response to 5-min distal cuff occlusion, was repeated after three separate brachial artery infusions of saline (SAL), N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and ketorolac (KETO) + L-NMMA in healthy younger men (M; n = 8) and women (W; n = 8). In eight subjects (4 M, 4W) RA FMD was reassessed on a separate day with drug order reversed (SAL, KETO, and L-NMMA + KETO). RA FMD was calculated as the peak dilatory response observed relative to baseline (%FMD) and expressed relative to the corresponding area under the curve shear stress (%FMD/AUC SS). L-NMMA reduced %FMD similarly and modestly (P = 0.68 for sex * trial interaction) in M and W (all subjects: 10.0 ± 3.8 to 7.6 ± 4.7%; P = 0.03) with no further effect of KETO (P = 0.68). However, all sex * trial and trial effects on %FMD/AUC SS for l-NMMA and KETO + l-NMMA were insignificant (all P &gt; 0.20). There was also substantial heterogeneity of the magnitude and direction of dilator responses to blockade. After l-NMMA infusion, subjects exhibited both reduced (n = 14; range: 11 to 78% decrease) and augmented (n = 2; range: 1 to 96% increase) %FMD. Following KETO + l-NMMA, seven subjects exhibited reduced dilation (range: 10 to 115% decrease) and nine subjects exhibited augmented dilation (range: 1 to 212% increase). Reversing drug order did not change the nature of the findings. These findings suggest that RA FMD is not fully or uniformly NO dependent in either men or women, and that there is heterogeneity in the pathways underlying the conduit dilatory response to ischemia.
Human six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate4 (STEAP4), an ortholog of mouse tumor necrosis factor-α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP), plays a role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent arthritis models. However, its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still obscure. This study explored such a role for STEAP4. The expressions of STEAP4, TNFα, and IL-6 were compared in synovia of RA and osteoarthritis patients. STEAP4 induction was examined in TNFα-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro. FLS (with/without TNFα stimulation) were also analyzed for IL-6 expression after STEAP4 knockdown, using siRNA or transfection with STEAP4-plasmid DNA. IL-8, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were also evaluated in STEAP4-overexpressing FLS. The expression of STEAP4 in joints correlated with TNFα expression, specifically in RA synovium. In the cultured FLS, STEAP4 protein expression was augmented by TNFα activation, and localized in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. STEAP4 downregulation by siRNA enhanced the expression of IL-6 mRNA, while STEAP4 overexpression suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 expression, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis via caspase-3. The results indicated that human STEAP4 is regulated by TNFα in synovium, where it controls IL-6 secretion and proliferation of FLS, suggesting that STEAP4 might potentially suppress the pathogenesis of TNFα-induced arthritis such as RA.
In rodents, exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with neurobehavioral impairments, increased apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as increased oxidant stress and inflammation. Excessive NADPH oxidase activity may play a role in IH-induced CNS dysfunction.
The effect of IH during light period on two forms of spatial learning in the water maze and well as markers of oxidative stress was assessed in mice lacking NADPH oxidase activity (gp91phox(_/Y)) and wild-type littermates. On a standard place training task, gp91phox(_/Y) displayed normal learning, and were protected from the spatial learning deficits observed in wild-type littermates exposed to IH. Moreover, anxiety levels were increased in wild-type mice exposed to IH as compared to room air (RA) controls, while no changes emerged in gp91phox(_/Y) mice. Additionally, wild-type mice, but not gp91phox(_/Y) mice had significantly elevated levels of NADPH oxidase expression and activity, as well as MDA and 8-OHDG in cortical and hippocampal lysates following IH exposures.
The oxidative stress responses and neurobehavioral impairments induced by IH during sleep are mediated, at least in part, by excessive NADPH oxidase activity, and thus pharmacological agents targeting NADPH oxidase may provide a therapeutic strategy in sleep-disordered breathing.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. Many cytokines have been found to be associated with RA pathogenesis and among them is macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The aim of this study was to determine whether MIF serum levels are associated with RA course, clinical activity, and clinical biomarkers of the disease. MIF levels were determined in serum samples of 54 RA patients and 78 healthy subjects (HS) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Disease activity was evaluated using the DAS28 score. Patients were subgrouped according to disease activity and years of evolution of disease. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS 10.0 and GraphPad Prism 5 software. RA patients presented increased levels of MIF as compared to HS. MIF levels were raised on early stages of RA and tend to decrease according to years of evolution. Moreover, MIF levels positively correlated with rheumatoid factor in RA patients and with C reactive protein in all individuals studied. Our findings suggest that MIF plays a role in early stages of RA.
To determine serum antibody against human and bacterial heat shock protein (HSP) 60/70 in myeloperoxidase (MPO)-specific anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) positive microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), 58 patients with MPO-ANCA positive MPA, 48 with RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and 40 with SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) were studied. Serum antibodies against HSP (human HSP 70, human HSP 60, Mycobacterium HSP 70, and Escherichia coli HSP 60) were measured by sandwich ELISA. The frequency of anti-human HSP 60/70 antibody positive patients was significantly greater in MPO-ANCA positive MPA than SLE and healthy controls. Anti-human HSP 60/70 antibody titers in patients with MPO-ANCA positive MPA were significantly higher than those of healthy controls; anti-bacterial HSP 60/70 antibody titers were also higher. There was a significant correlation between titers of anti-human HSP 70 antibody and anti-Mycobacterium HSP 70 antibody. A correlation was also found between titers of anti-human HSP 70 antibody and anti-human HSP 60 antibody. Anti-human and bacterial HSP 60/70 antibody titers changed in parallel with disease activity in patients with antibody positive MPA. The anti-HSP antibody titer was also increased in patients with RA and SLE. These results suggest that an immunological background via anti-HSP 60/70 antibodies might be associated with pathogenesis in MPO-ANCA positive MPA.
Imbalance oxidative stress and chemokines are considered as a universal factors involved in the development of various clinical features seen in the patients with SLE and arthritis. To evaluate the interaction between oxidative stress and chemokines and their relationship with disease activity in SLE and RA patients, oxidative/anti-oxidant profiles and chemokines were assessed. Oxidant and anti-oxidant enzymes were measured in the plasma and the levels of chemokines; MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1β/CCL-4 and IP-10/CXCL-10 were evaluated in the serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A significant increase in the level of lipid peroxidation was found in SLE and RA patients and positively associated with disease activity. The activities of anti-oxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and anti-oxidant molecule GSH were significantly reduced in both diseases. Strong positive associations were found between MDA with RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1β/CCL4 than MCP-1/CCL-2 in SLE patients while a sturdy connotation was seen with MIP-1β/CCL4 and MCP-1/CCL-2 in RA patients. The anti-oxidant molecule GSH shows a negative association with serum levels of MCP-1/CCL-2, RANTES/CCL5 and IP-10/CXCL-10 in SLE patients and with MCP-1/CCL-2 and RANTES/CCL5 in RA patients. A low level of GSH and high level of RANTES/CCL5 were associated with lupus nephritis patients. These results indicates that excessive production of ROS disturbs redox status and can modulate the expression of inflammatory chemokines leading to inflammatory processes, exacerbating inflammation and affecting tissue damage in autoimmune diseases, as exemplified by their strong association with disease activity.
Glutathione reductase (GR, NADPH:oxidized glutathione oxidoreductase, E.C 1.6.4.2) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GR is a crucial enzyme in the antioxidant system by maintaining reduced glutathione (GSH). Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P):NADP(+) oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) is the key regulatory enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and maintains NADPH for reductive reactions.
Rosmarinic acid (RA; α-O-caffeoyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid) is an ester of caffeic acid (CA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid. It has a number of interesting biological activities. The inhibiting activities of the RA on GR and G6PD are investigated here for the first time.
GR and G6PD were purified from tissues, then the effects of RA are investigated.
This study reports that RA, which was isolated from Echium vulgare L. (Boraginaceae), inhibits purified GR and G6PD in a concentration-dependent manner. Kinetic characterizations and inhibition constants are investigated.
Because of their importance in the antioxidative defense system, investigation of the inhibitors of these enzymes is important for drug development.
Uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up(4)A) was reported as a novel endothelium-derived contracting factor. Up(4)A contains both purine and pyrimidine moieties, which activate purinergic (P2)X and P2Y receptors. However, alterations in the vasoconstrictor responses to Up(4)A in hypertensive states remain unclear. The present study examined the effects of Up(4)A on contraction of isolated renal arteries (RA) and pulmonary arteries (PA) from DOCA-salt rats using isometric tension recording. RA from DOCA-salt rats exhibited increased contraction to Up(4)A versus arteries from control uninephrectomized rats in the absence and presence of N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). On the other hand, the Up(4)A-induced contraction in PA was similar between the two groups. Up(4)A-induced contraction was inhibited by suramin (nonselective P2 antagonist) but not by diinosine pentaphosphate pentasodium salt hydrate (Ip(5)I; P2X(1) antagonist) in RA from both groups. Furthermore, 2-thiouridine 5'-triphosphate tetrasodium salt (2-ThioUTP; P2Y(2) agonist)-, uridine-5'-(γ-thio)-triphosphate trisodium salt (UTPγS; P2Y(2)/P2Y(4) agonist)-, and 5-iodouridine-5'-O-diphosphate trisodium salt (MRS 2693; P2Y(6) agonist)-induced contractions were all increased in RA from DOCA-salt rats. Protein expression of P2Y(2)-, P2Y(4)-, and P2Y(6) receptors in RA was similar between the two groups. In DOCA-salt RA, the enhanced Up(4)A-induced contraction was reduced by PD98059, an ERK pathway inhibitor, and Up(4)A-stimulated ERK activation was increased. These data are the first to indicate that Up(4)A-induced contraction is enhanced in RA from DOCA-salt rats. Enhanced P2Y receptor signaling and activation of the ERK pathway together represent a likely mechanism mediating the enhanced Up(4)A-induced contraction. Up(4)A might be of relevance in the pathophysiology of vascular tone regulation and renal dysfunction in arterial hypertension.
Mutations in H6-homeobox (HMX) genes are linked to neural mispatterning and neural tube closure defects in humans. We demonstrate that zebrafish Hmx4 regulates the signaling of two morphogens critical for neural development, retinoic acid (RA) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Hmx4-depleted embryos have a strongly narrowed eye field and reduced forebrain Shh target gene expression. hmx4 morphants fail to properly transcribe the Shh signal transducer gli3, and have reduced ventral forebrain specification. Hmx4-depleted embryos also have neural tube patterning defects that phenocopy RA-deficiency. We show that Hmx4 is required for the initiation and maintenance of aldh1a2, the principal RA-synthesizing gene. Loss of RA is the primary defect in Hmx4-depleted embryos, as RA treatment rescues a number of the neural patterning defects. Surprisingly, RA treatment also rescues forebrain morphology, gli3 transcription, and Shh signaling. We propose that Hmx4 is a critical regulator of retinoic acid synthesis in a developing embryo, and that this regulation is essential for controlling Shh signaling and forebrain development.
During the early stages of body axis extension, retinoic acid (RA) synthesized in somites by Raldh2 represses caudal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling to limit the tailbud progenitor zone. Excessive RA down-regulates Fgf8 and triggers premature termination of body axis extension, suggesting that endogenous RA may function in normal termination of body axis extension. Here, we demonstrate that Raldh2-/- mouse embryos undergo normal down-regulation of tailbud Fgf8 expression and termination of body axis extension in the absence of RA. Interestingly, Raldh2 expression in wild-type tail somites and tailbud from E10.5 onwards does not result in RA activity monitored by retinoic acid response element (RARE)-lacZ. Treatment of wild-type tailbuds with physiological levels of RA or retinaldehyde induces RARE-lacZ activity, validating the sensitivity of RARE-lacZ and demonstrating that deficient RA synthesis in wild-type tail somites and tailbud is due to a lack of retinaldehyde synthesis. These studies demonstrate an early uncoupling of RA signaling from mouse tailbud development and show that termination of body axis extension occurs in the absence of RA signaling.
Although retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as an extrinsic signal regulating forebrain neurogenesis, the processes regulated by RA signaling remain unclear. Here, analysis of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase mutant mouse embryos lacking RA synthesis demonstrates that RA generated by Raldh3 in the subventricular zone of the basal ganglia is required for GABAergic differentiation, whereas RA generated by Raldh2 in the meninges is unnecessary for development of the adjacent cortex. Neurospheres generated from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE), where Raldh3 is highly expressed, produce endogenous RA, which is required for differentiation to GABAergic neurons. In Raldh3⁻/⁻ embryos, LGE progenitors fail to differentiate into either GABAergic striatal projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons migrating to the olfactory bulb and cortex. We describe conditions for RA treatment of human embryonic stem cells that result in efficient differentiation to a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons without the appearance of GABAergic striatal projection neurons, thus providing an in vitro method for generation of GABAergic interneurons for further study. Our observation that endogenous RA is required for generation of LGE-derived GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia establishes a key role for RA signaling in development of the forebrain.
Inhibition of the excessive NO production has been recognized as a potential means for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In order to discover more potent inhibitors and explore the preliminary structure activity relationship, a series of unique stereodimers of sinomenine analogues were designed and synthesized. Their inhibitory activity on NO production and cytotoxicity were evaluated using LPS-activated murine macrophages RAW264.7 assay and MTT method, respectively. Among these compounds, 1a, 2, 2a, 2b, and 4 showed potent inhibitory activity on NO production without obvious cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 2, 2a, and 2b significantly suppressed mRNA expression of iNOS. Interestingly, (S)-dimers displayed a better bioactivity than (R)-dimers. These compounds may sever as lead candidates in the development of novel therapeutic drugs for RA treatment.
The active metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), is a powerful regulator of gene transcription. RA is also a therapeutic drug. The oxidative metabolism of RA by certain members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily helps to maintain tissue RA concentrations within appropriate bounds. The CYP26 family--CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP26C1--is distinguished by being both regulated by and active toward all-trans-RA (at-RA) while being expressed in different tissue-specific patterns. The CYP26A1 gene is regulated by multiple RA response elements. CYP26A1 is essential for embryonic development, whereas CYP26B1 is essential for postnatal survival as well as germ cell development. Enzyme kinetic studies have demonstrated that several CYP proteins are capable of metabolizing at-RA; however, it is likely that CYP26A1 plays a major role in RA clearance. Thus, pharmacological approaches to limiting the activity of CYP26 enzymes may extend the half-life of RA and could be useful clinically in the future.
All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A. atRA is also used as a drug, and synthetic atRA analogs and inhibitors of retinoic acid (RA) metabolism have been developed. The hepatic clearance of atRA is mediated primarily by CYP26A1, but design of CYP26A1 inhibitors is hindered by lack of information on CYP26A1 structure and structure-activity relationships of its ligands. The aim of this study was to identify the primary metabolites of atRA formed by CYP26A1 and to characterize the ligand selectivity and ligand interactions of CYP26A1. On the basis of high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data, four metabolites formed from atRA by CYP26A1 were identified as 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, 16-OH-RA and 18-OH-RA. 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA were also substrates of CYP26A1. Forty-two compounds with diverse structural properties were tested for CYP26A1 inhibition using 9-cis-RA as a probe, and IC(50) values for 10 inhibitors were determined. The imidazole- and triazole-containing inhibitors [S-(R*,R*)]-N-[4-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(1H-imidazole-1-yl)propyl]-phenyl]2-benzothiazolamine (R116010) and (R)-N-[4-[2-ethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butyl]phenyl]-2-benzothiazolamine (R115866) were the most potent inhibitors of CYP26A1 with IC(50) values of 4.3 and 5.1 nM, respectively. Liarozole and ketoconazole were significantly less potent with IC(50) values of 2100 and 550 nM, respectively. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) γ agonist CD1530 was as potent an inhibitor of CYP26A1 as ketoconazole with an IC(50) of 530 nM, whereas the RARα and RARβ agonists tested did not significantly inhibit CYP26A1. The pan-RAR agonist 4-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands rosiglitazone and pioglitazone inhibited CYP26A1 with IC(50) values of 3.7, 4.2, and 8.6 μM, respectively. These data demonstrate that CYP26A1 has high ligand selectivity but accepts structurally related nuclear receptor agonists as inhibitors.
Insulin regulates the expression of genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, such as the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (Pck1). We have reported that lipophilic molecules from rat livers induced Pck1 transcription and attenuated insulin-mediated suppression of its expression in primary rat hepatocytes. After identification of retinol and retinal as the active molecules, the present study was aimed to determine the effects of retinoids on insulin-mediated suppression of Pck1 expression in primary rat hepatocytes. Real-time PCR and reporter gene assays were designed to determine retinoid effects in the absence or presence of insulin on the expression levels of Pck1 mRNA and activation of its promoter constructs, respectively. The lipophilic extract from rat livers specifically induced the expression of Pck1, but not that of two other insulin-suppressed genes, glucose 6-phosphatase catalytic subunit and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1. Retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid (RA) induced Pck1 expression dose-dependently in primary hepatocytes. Specific activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR), but not retinoid X receptor, attenuated insulin-mediated suppression of Pck1 expression. RARα antagonist (Ro41-5253) abolished the retinal-mediated induction of Pck1 expression and attenuation of insulin-mediated suppression of its expression. Disruption of the proximal, but not the distal, RA responsive element in the Pck1 promoter eliminated the RA response of Pck1 promoter reporter constructs in primary hepatocytes. The results of this study demonstrated for the first time that retinoid treatment attenuated insulin-mediated suppression of Pck1 expression in primary rat hepatocytes. It suggests that retinoid metabolism in hepatocytes may modulate hepatic insulin action.
Gold nanoparticles dispersed in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid (Au-BMI·PF(6)) were supported in chitin (CTN) chemically crosslinked with glyoxal and epichlorohydrin to obtain a new supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalyst with high catalytic activity, and providing an excellent environment for enzyme immobilization. This modified biopolymer matrix (Au-BMI·PF(6)-CTN) was used as a support for the immobilization of the enzyme peroxidase (PER) from pea (Pisum sativum), and employed to develop a new biosensor for rosmarinic acid (RA) determination in pharmaceutical samples by square-wave voltammetry. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the PER catalyzes the oxidation of RA to the corresponding o-quinone, which is electrochemically reduced at a potential of +0.14 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Under optimized conditions, the resulting peak current increased linearly for the RA concentration range of 0.50 to 23.70 μM with a detection limit of 70.09 nM. The biosensor demonstrated high sensitivity, good repeatability and reproducibility, and long-term stability (15% decrease in response over 120 days). The method was successfully applied to the determination of RA content in pharmaceutical samples, with recovery values being in the range of 98.3 to 106.2%. The efficient analytical performance of the proposed biosensor can be attributed to the effective immobilization of the PER enzyme in the modified CTN matrix, the significant contribution of the high conductivity of the ionic liquid, the facilitation of electron transfer promoted by gold nanoparticles, and the inherent catalytic ability of these materials.
Pharmacokinetics of ketoprofen (KTP) enantiomers has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg rac-KTP during multidrug therapy taking into consideration the genotype of RA patients Concentrations of (-)-R and (+)-S enantiomers of KTP in plasma, urine and synovial fluid samples were determined using a validated HPCE method. The genotype of the patients was analyzed using PCR-RFLP method to determine the polymorphic variants of genes coding CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes. The levels of KTP enantiomers in synovial fluid at 4 h following administration were insignificantly greater [(-)-R = 1.34 ± 0.91 mg/L; (+)-S = 1.38 ± 0.91 mg/L] than in plasma [(-)-R = 1.15 ± 0.95 mg/L; (+)-S = 1.22 ± 0.95 mg/L]. The values of AUC(0-∞) were 11.89 ± 5.00 and 10.92 ± 4.10 mg h/L for (-)-R and (+)-S enantiomer, respectively, and were lower compared with data obtained in healthy volunteers following administration of the same dose of rac-KTP. But, no statistically significant differences were observed also for C (max), Cl, V (d), t (0.5) and MRT of KTP enantiomers. The total percentage of unchanged KTP eliminated with urine of RA patients was in the range of 30-50% of the administered dose. Though RA patients represented the same wild genotype, quite significant variabilities (Cl((-)-R ) = 2.37-13.50 L/h and Cl((+)-S ) = 2.44-9.90 L/h) existed in the pharmacokinetics parameters of KTP. We concluded that KTP data obtained from healthy volunteers cannot be sufficient to predict disposition of KTP enantiomers in RA patients, especially when undergoing long-term multidrug therapy.
Retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A (retinol) that controls growth and development. The first step of RA synthesis is controlled by enzymes of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) families that catalyze oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde. The second step of RA synthesis is controlled by members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) that further oxidize retinaldehyde to produce RA. RA functions as a ligand for DNA-binding RA receptors that directly regulate transcription of specific target genes. Elucidation of the vitamin A metabolic pathway and investigation of the endogenous function of vitamin A metabolites has been greatly improved by development of mouse ADH, RDH, and RALDH loss-of-function models. ADH knockouts have demonstrated a postnatal role for this enzyme family in clearance of excess retinol to prevent vitamin A toxicity and in generation of RA for postnatal survival during vitamin A deficiency. A point mutation in Rdh10 generated by ethylnitrosourea has demonstrated that RDH10 generates much of the retinaldehyde needed for RA synthesis during embryonic development. Raldh1, Raldh2, and Raldh3 knockouts have demonstrated that RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3 generate most of the RA needed during embryogenesis. These mouse models serve as instrumental tools for providing new insight into retinoid function. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Retinoid and Lipid Metabolism.
To assess the effects of surface finishing condition (polished or alumina particle air abraded) on the biocompatibility of direct and indirect exposure to a nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) d.Sign®10 dental casting alloy on oral keratinocytes. Biocompatibility was performed by assessing cellular viability and morphology, metabolic activity, cellular toxicity and presence of inflammatory cytokine markers.
Discs of d.Sign®10 were cast, alumina particle air abraded and half were polished before surface roughness was determined by profilometry. Biocompatibility was assessed by placing the discs directly or indirectly (with immersion solutions) into contact with TR146 monolayers. Metal ion release was determined by ICP-MS. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion, metabolic activity by XTT and cellular toxicity by LDH. Inflammatory cytokine analysis was performed using sandwich ELISAs.
The mean polished Ra value was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.001) compared with the alumina particle air abraded discs but metal ion release was significantly increased for the polished discs. Significant reductions in cell density of polished compared with alumina particle air abraded discs was observed following direct or indirect exposure. A significant reduction in metabolic activity, increase in cellular toxicity and an increase in the presence of inflammatory cytokine markers was highlighted for the polished relative to the alumina particle air abraded discs at 24h.
Finishing condition of the Ni-Cr dental alloy investigated has important clinical implications. The approach of employing cell density and morphology, metabolic activity, cellular toxicity levels and inflammatory marker responses to TR146 epithelial cells combined with ICP-MS afforded the authors an increased insight into the complex processes dental alloys undergo in the oral environment.
Undifferentiated cell populations may influence tumor growth in malignant glioma. We investigated potential disruptions in the retinoic acid (RA) differentiation pathway that could lead to a loss of differentiation capacity, influencing patient prognosis. Expression of key molecules belonging to the RA differentiation pathway was analyzed in 283 astrocytic gliomas and was correlated with tumor proliferation, tumor differentiation, and patient survival. In addition, in situ concentrations of retinoids were measured in tumors, and RA signaling events were studied in vitro. Unlike other tumors, in gliomas expression of most RA signaling molecules increased with malignancy and was associated with augmented intratumoral retinoid levels in high-grade gliomas. Aberrantly expressed RA signaling molecules included i) the retinol-binding protein CRBP1, which facilitates cellular retinoid uptake; ii) ALDH1A1, capable of activating RA precursors; iii) the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1; and iv) the RA-binding protein FABP5, which can inhibit RA-induced differentiation. In contrast, expression of the RA-binding protein CRABP2, which fosters differentiation, was decreased in high-grade tumors. Moreover, expression of CRBP1 correlated with tumor proliferation, and FABP5 expression correlated with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype. CRBP1 and ALDH1A1 were independent prognostic markers for adverse patient survival. Our data indicate a complex and clinically relevant deregulation of RA signaling, which seems to be a central event in glioma pathogenesis.
Much hope is currently associated with individualization of therapy provided to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The search is underway for biochemical and clinical markers that would be useful in prediction of a good response to methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Along with clinical factors, genetic predisposition may also be helpful. Polymorphism of genes participating in MTX metabolism may affect the drug’s efficacy and the rate of adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic studies may contribute to more effective individualization of therapy for RA patients. The purpose of the study was to determine the significance of gene polymorphisms MTHFR C677T and A1298C for efficacy of MTX therapy in RA patients. Patients possessing determined polymorphisms should be particularly carefully evaluated because of a higher risk of occurrence of adverse effects.
In vertebrate embryos, retinoic acid (RA) synthesized in the mesoderm by Raldh2 emanates to the hindbrain neuroepithelium, where it induces anteroposterior (AP)-restricted Hox expression patterns and rhombomere segmentation. However, how appropriate spatiotemporal RA activity is generated in the hindbrain is poorly understood. By analyzing Pbx1/Pbx2 and Hoxa1/Pbx1 null mice, we found that Raldh2 is itself under the transcriptional control of these factors and that the resulting RA-deficient phenotypes can be partially rescued by exogenous RA. Hoxa1-Pbx1/2-Meis2 directly binds a specific regulatory element that is required to maintain normal Raldh2 expression levels in vivo. Mesoderm-specific Xhoxa1 and Xpbx1b knockdowns in Xenopus embryos also result in Xraldh2 downregulation and hindbrain defects similar to mouse mutants, demonstrating conservation of this Hox-Pbx-dependent regulatory pathway. These findings reveal a feed-forward mechanism linking Hox-Pbx-dependent RA synthesis during early axial patterning with the establishment of spatially restricted Hox-Pbx activity in the developing hindbrain.
Homozygous null mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2IIIb) or its ligand fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) results in duodenal atresia in mice. Mutations of either of these genes in humans cause Matthew-Wood syndrome and associated duodenal stenosis. Recently, mutations in the retinol-binding protein receptor gene STRA6 were reported to be implicated in this syndrome as well. This suggests that the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway interacts with the Fgf10-Fgfr2IIIb signaling pathway during duodenal development. Accordingly, we hypothesized that Fgfr2IIIb-/- mouse embryos would exhibit disruptions in expression of Raldh2, the gene for the enzyme that regulates the final step in the conversion of vitamin A to the active form RA, during duodenal atresia formation.
Fgfr2III -/- mice were generated from heterozygous breedings. Embryos were harvested between embryonic day (E) 11.0 to E 13.5 and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Duodenums were dissected out, fixed and photographed. Whole mount and section in situs were performed for Raldh2.
Fgfr2IIIb-/- embryos demonstrate subtle changes in the duodenal morphology by E11.5 with complete involution of the atretic precursor by E 13.5. Raldh2 appears to be down-regulated as early as E 11.5 in the atretic precursor a full 2 days before this segment disappears.
In Fgfr2IIIb-/- mouse embryos, a reduction of Raldh2 expression is observed within the region that is forming the atresia. This is the first demonstration of such an event in this model. As in humans, these results implicate disruptions between Fgfr2IIIb receptor function and RA signaling in the formation of this defect and indicate that Fgfr2IIIb-/- mouse embryos are a valid model for the study of the atretic spectrum of defects in human duodenal development.
The essential roles of SHH in anteroposterior (AP) and AER-FGF signalling in proximodistal (PD) limb bud development are well understood. In addition, these morphoregulatory signals are key components of the self-regulatory SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF feedback signalling system that regulates distal progression of limb bud development. This study uncovers an additional signalling module required for coordinated progression of limb bud axis development. Transcriptome analysis using Shh-deficient mouse limb buds revealed that the expression of proximal genes was distally extended from early stages onwards, which pointed to a more prominent involvement of SHH in PD limb axis development. In particular, retinoic acid (RA) target genes were upregulated proximally, while the expression of the RA-inactivating Cyp26b1 enzyme was downregulated distally, pointing to increased RA activity in Shh-deficient mouse limb buds. Further genetic and molecular analysis established that Cyp26b1 expression is regulated by AER-FGF signalling. During initiation of limb bud outgrowth, the activation of Cyp26b1 expression creates a distal 'RA-free' domain, as indicated by complementary downregulation of a transcriptional sensor of RA activity. Subsequently, Cyp26b1 expression increases as a consequence of SHH-dependent upregulation of AER-FGF signalling. To better understand the underlying signalling interactions, computational simulations of the spatiotemporal expression patterns and interactions were generated. These simulations predicted the existence of an antagonistic AER-FGF/CYP26B1/RA signalling module, which was verified experimentally. In summary, SHH promotes distal progression of limb development by enhancing CYP26B1-mediated RA clearance as part of a signalling network linking the SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF feedback loop to the newly identified AER-FGF/CYP26B1/RA module.
Microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES-1) is the terminal enzyme in the induced state of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis and constitutes a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. We examined the role of the prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) gene polymorphism in susceptibility to and severity of RA and related variations in the gene to its function. The PTGES gene polymorphism was analyzed in 3081 RA patients and 1900 controls from two study populations: Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA) and the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (Leiden EAC). Baseline disease activity score (DAS28) was employed as a disease severity measure. mPGES-1 expression was analyzed in synovial tissue from RA patients with known genotypes using immunohistochemistry. In the Swedish study population, among women a significant association with risk for RA was observed for PTGES single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in univariate analysis and for the distinct haplotype. These results were substantiated by meta-analysis of data from EIRA and Leiden EAC studies with overall OR 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.11-1.56). Several PTGES SNPs were associated with earlier onset of disease or with higher DAS28 in women with RA. Patients with the genotype associated with higher DAS28 exhibited significantly higher mPGES-1 expression in synovial tissue. Our data reveal a possible influence of PTGES polymorphism on the pathogenesis of RA and on disease severity through upregulation of mPGES-1 at the sites of inflammation. Genetically predisposed individuals may develop earlier and more active disease owing to this mechanism.
The production of retinoic acid (RA) by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for the induction of gut-tropic immune responses by driving the expression of intestinal-specific homing receptors, such as α4β7 and CCR9, upon T and B cell activation. However, how RA production is regulated during DC development remains unclear. We describe an unexpected role for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a negative regulator of retinal dehydrogenases (RALDH), the enzymes responsible for RA synthesis. The presence of PGE2 during DC differentiation inhibited RALDH expression in mouse and human DCs, abrogating their ability to induce CCR9 expression upon T cell priming. Furthermore, blocking PGE2 signaling increased the frequency of RALDH(+) DCs in vitro, and reducing PGE2 synthesis in vivo promoted the systemic emergence of RA-producing DCs and the priming of CCR9(+) T cells in nonintestinal sites such as the spleen. Finally, we found that PGE2 stimulated the expression of the inducible cyclic AMP early repressor, which appears to directly inhibit RALDH expression in DCs, thus providing mechanistic insight into how PGE2 signaling down-modulates RALDH. Given the role of PGE2 in regulating the development of RA-producing DCs, modulating this pathway may prove a novel means to control the development of gut-tropic immune responses.
Cdx1, an upstream regulator of Hox genes, is best characterized for its homeotic effects upon the developing axial skeleton, particularly in the neck. It responds to retinoic acid (RA) in both mouse embryos and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. By use of beta-galactosidase chemiluminescence, we show that a mouse Cdx1/lacZ reporter expressed in P19 EC cells responds to RA by the combined activities of an intron retinoic acid response element (RARE) and an upstream RARE. In contrast, a chicken Cdx1/lacZ reporter responds only by activity of the intron RARE. Database analyses upon Cdx1 from twenty three vertebrate species reveal that the intron RARE is structurally conserved in amniotes (eutherian mammals, marsupials, birds and Anole lizard), but not in Xenopus or fish. The upstream RARE is structurally conserved only in eutherian mammals. We conclude that the intron RARE originated at around the amphibian/amniote division, and the upstream RARE appeared around the marsupial/eutherian mammal division. In view of the site of action of Cdx1, we propose that acquisition of the intron RARE may have facilitated the substantial changes that occurred in the neck and anterior thorax at the advent of the amniotes. We present evidence that Cdx1 is also a developmental regulator of the female urogenital system, and we suggest that acquisition of the upstream RARE may have contributed to morphological divergence of marsupial and eutherian mammals.
Rose hip (Rosa canina) has been used as an herbal remedy against a wide range of ailments including inflammatory disorders. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of rose hips have been evaluated in vitro and active constituents have been isolated. Rose hip contains antioxidant nutrients and an anti-inflammatory galactolipid. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease where activated cells release reactive oxygen substances. Thus it could be relevant to investigate if rose hip had an anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect in this situation.
In this open case-control study 20 female patients with RA and 10 female controls were given 10.5 g rose hip powder daily (Litozin®) for 28 days. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and follow-up for the capacity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). The participants kept a food diary for the first 3 days and the last 3 days of the intervention period. The RA-patients completed The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and follow-up.
CRP-concentrations of both patients and healthy controls did not change. Nor was any effect found on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. There was no difference in food intake at baseline, but in the last week the RA-group reduced their energy intake.
10.5 g Litozin® in 28 days had neither effect on clinical symptoms or laboratory measurements in patients with RA or healthy controls. This is in contrast to previous intervention studies with rose hip powder that found a reduction in the concentration of CRP. The results of the present study indicate that a daily amount of approximately 10 g rose hip powder for one month has no anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect.
Cellular retinoic acid binding proteins are considered to be involved in retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathways. Our aim was to compare the expression and localization of cellular retinoic acid binding proteins I and II (CRABP I and II) in embryonic mouse hearts during normal development and after a single teratogenic dose of RA. Techniques such as real-time PCR, RT-PCR, Western blots and immunostaining were employed to examine hearts from embryos at 9-17 dpc. RA treatment at 8.5dpc affects production of CRABP I and II in the heart in the 48-h period. Changes in expression of mRNA for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II (Raldh2), Crabp1 and Crabp2 genes also occur within the same time window (i.e. 10-11dpc) after RA treatment. In the embryonic control heart these proteins are localized in groups of cells within the outflow tract (OT), and the atrioventricular endocardial cushions. A gradient of labeling is observed with CRABP II but not for CRABP I along the myocardium of the looped heart at 11 dpc; this gradient is abolished in hearts treated with RA, whereas an increase of RALDH2 staining has been observed at 10 dpc in RA-treated hearts. Some populations of endocardial endothelial cells were intensively stained with anti-CRABP II whereas CRABP I was negative in these structures. These results suggest that CRABP I and II are independently regulated during heart development, playing different roles in RA signaling, essential for early remodeling of the heart tube and alignment of the great arteries to their respective ventricles.
Zebrafish heart regeneration occurs through the activation of cardiomyocyte proliferation in areas of trauma. Here, we show that within 3 hr of ventricular injury, the entire endocardium undergoes morphological changes and induces expression of the retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme raldh2. By one day posttrauma, raldh2 expression becomes localized to endocardial cells at the injury site, an area that is supplemented with raldh2-expressing epicardial cells as cardiogenesis begins. Induced transgenic inhibition of RA receptors or expression of an RA-degrading enzyme blocked regenerative cardiomyocyte proliferation. Injured hearts of the ancient fish Polypterus senegalus also induced and maintained robust endocardial and epicardial raldh2 expression coincident with cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas poorly regenerative infarcted murine hearts did not. Our findings reveal that the endocardium is a dynamic, injury-responsive source of RA in zebrafish, and indicate key roles for endocardial and epicardial cells in targeting RA synthesis to damaged heart tissue and promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Much of the heart, including the atria, right ventricle and outflow tract (OFT) is derived from a progenitor cell population termed the second heart field (SHF) that contributes progressively to the embryonic heart during cardiac looping. Several studies have revealed anterior-posterior patterning of the SHF, since the anterior region (anterior heart field) contributes to right ventricular and OFT myocardium whereas the posterior region gives rise to the atria. We have previously shown that Retinoic Acid (RA) signal participates to this patterning. We now show that Hoxb1, Hoxa1, and Hoxa3, as downstream RA targets, are expressed in distinct sub-domains within the SHF. Our genetic lineage tracing analysis revealed that Hoxb1, Hoxa1 and Hoxa3-expressing cardiac progenitor cells contribute to both atria and the inferior wall of the OFT, which subsequently gives rise to myocardium at the base of pulmonary trunk. By contrast to Hoxb1(Cre), the contribution of Hoxa1-enhIII-Cre and Hoxa3(Cre)-labeled cells is restricted to the distal regions of the OFT suggesting that proximo-distal patterning of the OFT is related to SHF sub-domains characterized by combinatorial Hox genes expression. Manipulation of RA signaling pathways showed that RA is required for the correct deployment of Hox-expressing SHF cells. This report provides new insights into the regulatory gene network in SHF cells contributing to the atria and sub-pulmonary myocardium.
The beetle family Cholevidae (Coleoptera: Staphylinoidea), sometimes viewed as the subfamily Cholevinae of the Leiodidae, consists of some 1700 species worldwide. With the exception of specialized cave-dwelling species and species living in bird and mammal nests and burrows, the species are generalized soil-dwellers that, at least in temperate regions, are mostly found on vertebrate cadavers. Although they have been regularly reported from human corpses, and offer potential because of many species' peak activity in the cold season, they have not been a focus of forensic entomologists so far. This is probably due to their small size and the difficulty in identifying the adults and their larvae. In this paper, we show that DNA-barcoding can help make this group of necrobiont beetles available as a tool for forensic research. We collected 86 specimens of 20 species of the genera Catops, Fissocatops, Apocatops, Choleva, Nargus, Ptomaphagus, and Sciodrepoides from the Netherlands and France and show that a broad "barcoding gap" allows almost all species to be easily and unambiguously identified by the sequence of the "barcoding gene" cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). This opens up the possibility of adding Cholevidae to the set of insect taxa routinely used in forensic entomology.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan-degrading enzyme which suppresses T lymphocyte activity and induces Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) polarisation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of IDO in freshly isolated peripheral cells as well as to enumerate Tregs and Th17 subpopulation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.
The percentage of IDO-expressing cells as well as Tregs and Th17 was evaluated in 14 active RA- (aRA), 13 inactive RA- (iRA), 7 aSLE-, 12 iSLE-treated patients and 11 healthy donors (controls). Intracellular IDO was analysed by flow cytometry in CD14+, CD8α+, CD16+ and CD123+ cell subpopulations. Tregs and Th17 were assessed by intracellular of Foxp3 and IL17A detection in CD4+ CD14- cells. A total of 50,000 events were recorded for each sample.
The amounts of CD14+/CD16-/IDO+, CD14-/CD16+/IDO+ and CD14+/CD16+/IDO+-expressing peripheral cells were slightly lower in inactive vs. active disease in RA and SLE patients. Notwithstanding, only inactive patients had statistically significant lower percentages when compared to controls. aRA and iRA showed a statistically significant decrease in CD8α+/CD123+/IDO+ vs. controls. Meanwhile, only iSLE patients had lower CD8α+/CD123+/IDO+ cells vs. aSLE patients and controls. Th17 subset was present in higher amounts in aRA and iRA patients vs. controls. Tregs showed an increase in aRA patients vs. controls.
A decreased percentage of IDO-expressing peripheral cells were determined in iRA and iSLE compared to controls. It could play a critical role in tolerance loss in these diseases.
Retinoic acid (RA) is purported to be required for expression of genes controlling proximodistal (Meis2) or anteroposterior (Shh) limb patterning. Embryos lacking RDH10, the primary enzyme synthesizing retinaldehyde during mouse development, survive until E14.5 with stunted forelimbs but apparently normal hindlimbs. Using embryos carrying the RARE-lacZ RA-reporter transgene, we show that endogenous RA activity in Rdh10(trex/trex) mutants is detected in neuroectoderm but not limbs during initiation and patterning. Treatment of Rdh10 mutants with 25 nM RA restores RARE-lacZ activity to limb mesoderm, validating RARE-lacZ and verifying that RA is absent in mutant limbs. In Rdh10 mutants, hindlimbs exhibit normal Meis2/Shh expression and skeletal patterning, and although forelimbs are growth-retarded their Meis2 expression remains normal. Later in development, Rdh10 mutants lack interdigital RA activity and accordingly fail to exhibit normal loss of interdigital mesenchyme. These findings demonstrate that RA is unnecessary for limb patterning but required later for interdigital tissue loss.
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a novel and recently discovered enzyme, is involved in the biosynthesis of uridine. Leflunomide (CAS 75706-12-6), a drug approved for the treatment of treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was identified as an inhibitor of DHODH. Structure based drug design using the leflunomide/DHODH X-ray structure yielded novel inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. Such drug candidates are in clinical trials against various autoimmune diseases.
The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is not fully understood and there is no effective treatment for this disease. Retinoic acid (RA) can modulate connective tissue metabolism, exhibit anti-fibrotic activity, and improve the clinical symptoms of SSc. However, the mechanisms by which RA elicits its anti-fibrotic actions remain to be determined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which RA exerts beneficial effects on scleroderma. Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with scleroderma were treated with RA and their effect on the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (LOX), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), type I and type III collagen was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western immunoblotting. The effect of MK886, a 5-LOX-specific inhibitor, on the expression of TGF-β1, CTGF, type I and type III collagen was also examined by RT-PCR. In cultured scleroderma fibroblasts, the expression of 5-LOX was elevated compared with normal human dermal fibroblasts. RA significantly inhibited the expression of 5-LOX and of TGF-β1, CTGF, type I and type III collagen. We further found that the expression of TGF-β1, CTGF and type I and type III collagen mRNA was inhibited by MK886 in scleroderma fibroblasts. In vitro, RA reduced 5-LOX expression in scleroderma fibroblasts and downregulated TGF-β1 and CTGF expression, leading to the inhibition of type I and type III collagen synthesis. Our results indicate that the clinical effects of RA on scleroderma are, at least in part, attributable to the reduction of 5-LOX expression and the subsequent suppression of TGF-β1 and CTGF expression that results in the blockade of collagenogenesis.
Epicardial-derived signals are key regulators of cardiac embryonic development. An important part of these signals is known to relate to a retinoic acid (RA) receptor-dependent mechanism. RA is a potent morphogen synthesised by Raldh enzymes, Raldh2 being the predominant one in mesodermal tissues. Despite the importance of epicardial retinoid signalling in the heart, the molecular mechanisms controlling cardiac Raldh2 transcription remain unknown. In the current study, we show that Wt1-null epicardial cells display decreased expression of Raldh2 both in vivo and in vitro. Using a RA-responsive reporter, we have confirmed that Wt1-null epicardial cells actually show reduced synthesis of RA. We also demonstrate that Raldh2 is a direct transcriptional target of Wt1 in epicardial cells. A secondary objective of this study was to identify the status of RA-related receptors previously reported to be critical to epicardial biology (PDGFRα,β; RXRα). PDGFRα and PDGFRβ mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in the absence of Wt1, but only Pdgfra expression is rescued by the addition of RA to Wt1-null epicardial cells. RXRα mRNA levels are not affected in Wt1-null epicardial cells. Taken together, our results indicate that Wt1 critically regulates epicardial RA signalling via direct activation of the Raldh2 gene, and identify a role for Wt1 in the regulation of morphogen receptors involved in the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of epicardial and epicardially-derived cells (EPDC).
High myeloperoxidase (MPO) serum levels have been shown in several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the correlation between MPO levels and disease activity in RA patients is still controversial. The aim of the study was to determine MPO plasma levels in RA patients and to investigate potential correlations between MPO levels and disease activity and treatment. MPO plasma levels were measured by ELISA according the manufacturer's instructions. Disease activity was measured by DAS28 ESR and DAS28 CRP scores, and patients were classified into 4 groups: group 1 DAS28 &lt; 2.6; group 2: 2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2; group 3: 3.2 &lt; DAS28 ≤ 5.1 and group 4: DAS28 &gt; 5.1. Rheumatoid factor (RF) was measured by latex agglutination test, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies were detected by ELISA with a commercial kit. Fifty-seven female RA patients (mean age: 46.02 ± 13.47 years, mean disease duration: 115.77 ± 99.44 months) and sixty gender- and age-paired healthy controls were included. Mean MPO plasma levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (72.27 pM vs. 40.78 pM, P = 0.007). RF was found in 59.6% and anti-CCP in 80.7% of the RA patients. No significant difference in MPO levels was seen among the four RA disease activity groups. We did not find significant correlation between MPO levels and disease activity as measured by DAS28 score. In conclusion, we observed significantly higher MPO plasma levels in RA patients when compared to healthy controls. However, we did not find correlation between MPO plasma level and disease activity.
A new group of autoantibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies directed to citrulline-containing proteins, which are of value for the severity of RA. Up to date, the relationship between anti-CCP antibodies and oxidant, anti-oxidant activity in patients with RA has not been elucidated in the previous studies. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of anti-CCP antibodies in the circulation on whole blood, serum and synovial fluid oxidant and anti-oxidant activity in patients with RA.
RA patients with anti-CCP (+) (n=25) and anti-CCP (-) (n=24) were recruited into the study. All patients had a positive rheumatoid factor (RF). The patients who were under treatment with only non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) at the study time included in the study. Catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and the levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in whole blood, serum and synovial fluid in both groups.
There were no significant differences in terms of the mean whole blood and serum antioxidative activity (CAT, GSHpx) and the mean blood and serum MDA and MPO values (oxidative activity), between the patients with anti-CCP(+) and those with anti-CCP(-). There was increased synovial oxidant activity (MDA and MPO levels) (p&lt;0.05) in anti-CCP(+) RA patients with or without ESR negativity when compared with anti-CCP(-) RA patients. There was positive correlation between anti-CCP antibody levels and synovial MDA and MPO levels (r=0.435, p&lt;0.05, r=0.563, p&lt;0.05 respectively) in anti-CCP (+) group.
In conclusion, anti-CCP antibody positivity seems to be associated with increased synovial fluid oxidant activity (increased MDA and MPO levels) in patients with RA. These conclusions need to be validated in a larger controlled study population.
The reduction kinetics of the fluorescently labeled small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor was studied by stopped flow kinetic measurements. The tryptophan fluorescence and the emission from a covalently attached label were used to selectively follow the progress of the reduction of the trinuclear copper center (TNC) and the type-1 (T1) Cu site in the enzyme as a function of time. A numerical analysis of the kinetic traces provided new insight into the midpoint potential difference between the T1 and the TNC site as the TNC becomes stepwise charged with electrons. The change in fluorescence of the TNC as the reduction of the TNC proceeds provided evidence that the type-3 dinuclear part of the TNC becomes charged prior to the reduction of the type-2 (T2) center of the TNC. The rate of reduction of the enzyme by dithionite (DT) appeared proportional to the square root of the DT concentration with a rate constant of k(red) = 0.28 +/- 0.02 microM(-1/2) s(-1).
Gold(I)-based drugs have been used successfully for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for several years. Although the exact mechanism of action of these gold(I) drugs for RA has not been clearly established, the interaction of these compounds with mammalian enzymes has been extensively studied. In this paper, we describe the interaction of therapeutic gold(I) compounds with mammalian proteins that contain cysteine (Cys) and selenocysteine (Sec) residues. Owing to the higher affinity of gold(I) towards sulfur and selenium, gold(I) drugs rapidly react with the activated cysteine or selenocysteine residues of the enzymes to form protein-gold(I)-thiolate or protein-gold(I)-selenolate complexes. The formation of stable gold(I)-thiolate/selenolate complexes generally lead to inhibition of the enzyme activity. The gold-thiolate/selenolate complexes undergo extensive ligand exchange reactions with other nucleophiles and such ligand exchange reactions alter the inhibitory effects of gold(i) complexes. Therefore, the effect of gold(I) compounds on the enzymatic activity of cysteine- or selenocysteine-containing proteins may play important roles in RA. The interaction of gold(I) compounds with different enzymes and the biochemical mechanism underlying the inhibition of enzymatic activities may have broad medicinal implications for the treatment of RA.
B cells may play an important role in promoting immune activation in the rheumatoid synovium and can produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) when activated. In its turn, PGE(2) formed by cyclooxygenase (COX) and microsomal prostaglandin E(2) synthase 1 (MPGES1) contributes to the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathological process. Therapeutic depletion of B cells results in important improvement in controlling disease activity in rheumatoid patients. Therefore we investigated the expression of PGE(2) pathway enzymes in RA B cells and evaluated the effects of B cell depleting therapy on their expression in RA tissue.
B cells expressing MPGES1 and COX-2 were identified by flow cytometry in in vitro stimulated and control mononuclear cells isolated from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of RA patients. Synovial biopsies were obtained from 24 RA patients before and at two consecutive time points after rituximab therapy. Expression of MPGES1, COX-1 and COX-2, as well as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, known inducers of MPGES1, was quantified in immunostained biopsy sections using computerized image analysis.
Expression of MPGES1 or COX-2 was significantly upregulated upon stimulation of B cells from blood and synovial fluid while control cells displayed no detectable enzymes. In synovial biopsy sections, the expression of MPGES1, COX-1 or COX-2 was resistant to rituximab therapy at 8 or 16 weeks after start of treatment. Furthermore expression of IL-1β in the synovial tissue remained unchanged, while IL-6 tended to decrease after therapy.
Therapy with B cell depleting agents, although efficient in achieving good clinical and radiographic response in RA patients, leaves important inflammatory pathways in the rheumatoid synovium essentially unaffected.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem disease of unknown cause. Formation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides as a result of disease activity may play an important role. Oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant status are the hallmarks in patients of RA as observed in recent years. The objectives of the study was to determine oxidative stress by measuring malondialdehyde and enzymatic antioxidant status by estimating superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase in patients of RA and then comparing with healthy individuals.
The present study comprises of 40 RA cases who were clinically diagnosed and confirmed by laboratory tests, attending KLE Society's Dr. Prabhakar Kore Hospital and Research Centre, Belgaum. Southern India attached to J. N. Medical College. between September 2007 to August 2008. All the patients were in the age group of 40-60 years including both the sexes. Biochemical parameters like malondialdehyde, enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were estimated in cases (40) and controls (40).
The mean level of blood malondialdehyde (in nmol/ml) in controls was 6.19 +/- 0.96 and 11.48 +/- 0.76 in cases. The mean level of superoxide dismutase (IU/g of Hb) in controls was 948.32 +/- 99.88 and 443.68 +/- 111.69 in the cases. The mean glutathione reductase level (in IU/g of Hb) in controls was 8.91 +/- 1.04 and 2.96 +/- 0.79 in the cases.
This study revealed that there was an increased oxidative stress and a decreased antioxidant defense in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Cholestasis leads to liver cell death, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure. Despite limited benefits, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for cholestatic disorders. Retinoic acid (RA) is a ligand for nuclear receptors that modulate bile salt homeostasis. RA also possesses immunomodulatory effects and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia and inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, acne, and rheumatoid arthritis. To test whether the supplementation of RA with UDCA is superior to UDCA alone for treating cholestasis, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent common bile duct ligation (BDL) for 14 days and were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), UDCA, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), or UDCA and atRA by gavage. Treatment with UDCA and atRA substantially improved animal growth rates, significantly reduced liver fibrosis and bile duct proliferation, and nearly eliminated liver necrosis after BDL. Reductions in the bile salt pool size and liver hydroxyproline content were also seen with treatment with atRA or atRA and UDCA versus PBS and UDCA. Furthermore, atRA and UDCA significantly reduced liver messenger RNA and/or protein expression of transforming growth factor β1 (Tgf-β1), collagen 1a1 (Col1A1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), cytokeratin 19, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-β1. The molecular mechanisms of this treatment were also assessed in human hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and LX-2 cells. atRA alone or in combination with UDCA greatly repressed CYP7A1 expression in human hepatocytes and significantly inhibited COL1A1, MMP2, and α-SMA expression and/or activity in primary human hepatic stellate cells and LX-2 cells. Furthermore, atRA reduced TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in LX-2 cells.
Our findings indicate that the addition of RA to UDCA reduces the bile salt pool size and liver fibrosis and might be an effective supplemental therapy with UDCA for cholestatic diseases.
The genetic structure of populations can be influenced by geographic isolation (including physical distance) and ecology. We examined these effects in Leptopilina boulardi, a parasitoid of Drosophila of African origin and widely distributed over temperate and (sub) tropical climates.
We sampled 11 populations of L. boulardi from five climatic zones in Iran and measured genetic differentiation at nuclear (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism; AFLP) and mitochondrial (Cytochrome Oxidase I; COI) loci. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) for the AFLP data revealed that 67.45% of variation resided between populations. No significant variation was observed between climatic zones. However, a significant difference was detected between populations from the central (dry) regions and those from the wetter north, which are separated by desert. A similarly clear cut genetic differentiation between populations from the central part of Iran and those from the north was observed by UPGMA cluster analysis and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO). Both UPGMA and PCO further separated two populations from the very humid western Caspian Sea coast (zone 3) from other northern populations from the temperate Caspian Sea coastal plain (zone 2), which are connected by forest. One population (Nour) was genetically intermediate between these two zones, indicating some gene flow between these two groups of populations. In all analyses a mountain population, Sorkhabad was found to be genetically identical to those from the nearby coastal plain (zone 2), which indicates high gene flow between these populations over a short geographical distance. One population from the Caspian coast (Astaneh) was genetically highly diverged from all other populations. A partial Mantel test showed a highly significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances, as well as separation by the deserts of central Iran. The COI sequences were highly conserved among all populations.
The Iranian populations of L. boulardi showed clear genetic structure in AFLP profiles, but not in COI sequence data. The transfer of fruits containing Drosophila larvae parasitized by L. boulardi appears to have caused some unexpected gene flow and changed the genetic composition of populations, particularly in urban areas. Nevertheless, our results suggest that climate, geographic distance and physical barriers may all have contributed to the formation of genetically distinct populations of L. boulardi. Inevitably, there will be overlap between the portions of variance explained by these variables. Disentangling the relative contributions of climate and geography to the genetic structure of this species will require additional sampling.
Cortisol levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are considered inadequate to ongoing inflammation. One possible mechanism ofthe relative cortisol deficit can be decreased 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11BHSD1) activity, an enzyme that converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol. The aim of the study was to determine systemic and local activity of 11 BHSD1 in female patients with RA.
Six female RA patients without glucocorticoid therapy (age 29 +/- 2 years, BMI 21 +/- 1 kg/m2) and six healthy women (age 30 +/- 2 years, BMI 21 +/- 1 kg/m2) were studied. Endogenous cortisol production was suppressed by dexamethasone. 11BHSD1 activity was evaluated by changes in concentrations of total plasma, free plasma, salivary and cortisol in subcutaneous adipose tissue after cortisone acetate administration (25 mg per os).
Concentrations of total plasma, free plasma, salivary, and tissue cortisol increased significantly, however there was no significant difference between RA patients and controls.
The result suggests comparable systemic and adipose tissue conversion of cortisone to cortisol. Despite chronic inflammation, systemic activity of 11BHSD1 is not responsible for relative adrenal deficiency in RA. Changes in local activity of the enzyme in tissues affected by inflammatory process cannot be excluded.
Oxidants play a significant role in causing oxidative stress, which underlies the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genetic factors that predispose individuals to RA are considered to play an important role in the development of the disease. The aim of this study was to determine, by use of the comet assay and the micronucleus (MN) test, whether DNA damage has an effect on the pathogenesis of RA. Furthermore, our aim was to show if there is an association between oxidative stress and DNA damage in RA. This study was conducted between January and June 2010 in the Erzurum Training and Research Hospital. We analyzed lymphocytes from patients with RA (12 in active and 31 in inactive periods) and 30 healthy controls for effects in the comet assay and the MN test. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) rate were determined in all the subjects. The comet-tail length, the MN frequencies and the MDA levels were significantly higher in patients--both in the active and the inactive period--than in the controls. In contrast, the SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in both patient groups than in the controls. Our results suggest that an increased plasma MDA level and decreased plasma GSH-Px and SOD levels reflect the higher degree of oxidative stress in RA patients, a situation that may impair genetic stability in those patients. Thus, the results suggest that increased DNA damage may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA.
We compared local immunometabolic effects of two dosage forms of longidase in patients with prostatic adenoma (PA) in combination with chronic prostatitis (CP) in the postoperative period. Transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate was conducted in 81 patients aged 50-70 years suffering from PA and CP. All the patients after TUR were divided into three groups by postoperative treatment: group 1 (n = 25) received standard pharmacotherapy, group 2 (n = 28)--standard pharmacotherapy and longidase injections, group 3--standard pharmacotherapy plus longidase suppository. Immunological parameters were studied in biological material (urine) obtained before operation, after it and after treatment course. By changes in immunometabolic status (concentrations of cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, receptor antagonist IL-1 Ra, complement components C3-, C3a-, C4-, C5-, C5a, regulators of the complement system factor H, C1-inhibitor) and sIgA, content of acylhydroperoxides, malonic dialdehyde, stable metabolites of hitric oxide, catalase and superoxiddismutase activity it is shown that PA patients with CP have pretreatment disturbances of local immunity and oxidant status (high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, subnormal IL-10, activated complement system, lipid peroxidation, low sIgA, NO-synthetic activity of capillary endothelial activity). TUR aggravates shifts of local immunometabolic status. Standard postoperative pharmacotherapy does not correct the disturbances adequately. The addition of longidase to standard postoperative treatment was effective in correction of immune and oxidant status. Thus, longidase injections and, especially, suppositories correct disturbances of local immunity and oxidant status in patients with PA and CP in postoperative period.
The vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), plays important roles in the regulation of lymphocyte properties. Dendritic cells in gut-related lymphoid organs can produce RA, thereby imprinting gut-homing specificity on T cells and enhancing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-dependent induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells upon antigen presentation. In general, RA concentrations in cells and tissues are regulated by its degradation as well. However, it remained unclear if T cells could actively catabolize RA.
We assessed the expression of known RA-catabolizing enzymes in T cells from mouse lymphoid tissues. Antigen-experienced CD44+ T cells in gut-related lymphoid organs selectively expressed Cyp26b1, a member of the cytochrome P450 family 26. However, T cells in the spleen or skin-draining lymph nodes did not significantly express Cyp26b1. Accordingly, physiological levels of RA (1-10 nM) could induce Cyp26b1 expression in naïve T cells upon activation in vitro, but could not do so in the presence of TGF-β. Overexpression of Cyp26b1 significantly suppressed the RA effect to induce expression of the gut-homing receptor CCR9 on T cells. On the other hand, knocking down Cyp26b1 gene expression with small interfering RNA or inhibiting CYP26 enzymatic activity led to enhancement of the RA-induced CCR9 expression.
Our data demonstrate a role for CYP26B1 in regulating RA-dependent signals in activated T cells but not during TGF-β-dependent differentiation to Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Aberrant expression of CYP26B1 may disturb T cell trafficking and differentiation in the gut and its related lymphoid organs.
Optimization of compounds 5 and 6 led to the discovery of VEGF inhibitor 10g which reduced CYP inhibition. It was highly active in vitro (VEGF induced HUVEC proliferation assay) and showed efficacies in three disease models in vivo (cancer, RA, and AMD).
Retinoic acid (RA) is required for germ cell differentiation, the regulation of which gives rise to a constant production of mature sperm. In testes from 3-day postpartum (dpp) RARE-hsplacZ mice, periodic regions positive for beta-galactosidase activity were observed along the length of the seminiferous tubules. Periodicity was abolished by treatment of neonates with exogenous RA at 2 dpp. To assess the consequences, 2-dpp mice were treated with RA, and the long- and short-term effects were assessed. Long-term effects of neonatal RA exposure included a delay in the appearance of advanced germ cells and the absence of a spermatogenic wave (synchronous spermatogenesis) in the adult. In contrast, RA exposure in vitamin A-sufficient adults did not result in synchronous spermatogenesis but rather induced apoptosis in a subset of spermatogonia. Shortly after (24 h) neonates were exposed, altered expression of known germ cell differentiation and the (Stra8, Kit, Sycp3, and Rec8) meiosis markers and an increase in the number of STRA8 and SYCP3 immunopositive cells were observed relative to those of vehicle controls. However, 48 and 72 h after exposure, a significant reduction in the number of STRA8 and SYCP3 immunopositive cells occurred. Immunohistochemical analysis of a marker for apoptosis demonstrated neonatal exposure resulted in increased germ cell apoptosis, as observed in the adult. Additionally, RA exposure resulted in increased Cyp26a1 expression of the RA-degrading enzyme. Thus, while RA treatment of neonatal and adult mice resulted in apoptosis of spermatogonia, synchronous spermatogenesis occurred only after neonatal RA exposure.
The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) plays a crucial role in mucosal immune responses. We demonstrate in this study that RA-producing retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes are postnatally induced in mesenteric lymph node (MLN) dendritic cells (DCs) and MLN stromal cells. RALDH enzyme activity in lamina propria-derived CD103(+) MLN-DCs did not depend on TLR signaling. Remarkably, RA itself could directly induce RALDH2 in both DCs and stromal cells in vitro. Furthermore, upon provision of a vitamin A-deficient diet, it was found that RA-mediated signaling was strongly reduced within the small intestines, while RALDH2 mRNA and RALDH enzyme activity in lamina propria DCs and MLN-DCs, as well as RALDH2 mRNA expression in MLN stromal cells, were strongly diminished. Moreover, supply of vitamin A to vitamin A-deficient mice restored RA-mediated signaling in the intestine and RALDH activity in lamina propria-derived CD103(+) MLN-DCs. Our results show that RA-dependent signaling within the intestine is indispensable for RALDH activity in the draining MLN.
The fetal ductus arteriosus (DA) contracts to oxygen, and this feature, maturing through gestation, is considered important for its closure at birth. We have previously obtained evidence of the involvement of cytochrome P-450, possibly of the 3A subfamily (CYP3A), in oxygen sensing and have also identified endothelin (ET)-1 as the attendant effector for the contraction. Here, we examined comparatively wild-type (WT) and CYP3A-null (Cyp3a(-/-)) mice for direct validation of this concept. We found that the CYP3A subfamily is represented only by CYP3A13 in the WT DA. CYP3A13 was also detected in the DA by immunofluorescence microscopy, being primarily colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum in both endothelial and muscle cells. However, a distinct signal was also evident in the plasma membrane. Isolated DAs from term WT animals developed a sustained contraction to oxygen with transient contractions superimposed. Conversely, no tonic response occurred in Cyp3a(-/-) DAs, whereas the phasic response persisted unabated. Oxygen did not contract the preterm WT DA but caused a full-fledged contraction after retinoic acid (RA) treatment. RA also promoted an oxygen contraction in the Cyp3a(-/-) DA. However, responses of RA-treated WT and Cyp3a(-/-) mice differed in that only the former abated with ET-1 suppression. This implies the existence of an alternative target for RA responsible for the oxygen-induced contraction in the absence of CYP3A13. In vivo, the DA was constricted in WT and Cyp3a(-/-) newborns, although with a tendency to be less narrowed in the mutant. We conclude that oxygen acts primarily through the complex CYP3A13 (sensor)/ET-1 (effector) and, in an accessory way, directly onto ET-1. However, even in the absence of CYP3A13, the DA may close postnatally thanks to the contribution of ET-1 and the likely involvement of compensating mechanism(s) identifiable with an alternative oxygen-sensing system and/or the withdrawal of relaxing influence(s) operating prenatally.
Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress may play a key role in joint destruction due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that maintains the cellular defence against oxidative stress, in RA.
The activation status of Nrf2 was assessed in synovial tissue from patients with RA using immunohistochemistry. Antibody-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced in Nrf2-knockout and Nrf2-wild-type control mice. The severity of cartilage destruction was evaluated using a damage score. The extent of oxidative stress, the activation state of Nrf2 and the expression level of Nrf2 target genes were analysed by immunhistological staining. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A was examined on mRNA and protein using the Luminex technique. A Xenogen imaging system was used to measure Nrf2 activity in an antioxidant response element-luciferase transgenic mouse during AIA.
Nrf2 was activated in the joints of arthritic mice and of patients with RA. Nrf2-knockout mice had more severe cartilage injuries and more oxidative damage, and the expression of Nrf2 target genes was enhanced in Nrf2-wild-type but not in knockout mice during AIA. Both VEGF-A mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in Nrf2-knockout mice during AIA. An unexpected finding was the number of spontaneously fractured bones in Nrf2-knockout mice with AIA.
These results provide strong evidence that oxidative stress is significantly involved in cartilage degradation in experimental arthritis, and indicate that the presence of a functional Nrf2 gene is a major requirement for limiting cartilage destruction.
Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) catabolize toxic aldehydes and process the vitamin A-derived retinaldehyde into retinoic acid (RA), a small diffusible molecule and a pivotal chordate morphogen. In this study, we combine phylogenetic, structural, genomic, and developmental gene expression analyses to examine the evolutionary origins of ALDH substrate preference. Structural modeling reveals that processing of small aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde, by ALDH2, versus large aldehydes, including retinaldehyde, by ALDH1A is associated with small versus large substrate entry channels (SECs), respectively. Moreover, we show that metazoan ALDH1s and ALDH2s are members of a single ALDH1/2 clade and that during evolution, eukaryote ALDH1/2s often switched between large and small SECs after gene duplication, transforming constricted channels into wide opened ones and vice versa. Ancestral sequence reconstructions suggest that during the evolutionary emergence of RA signaling, the ancestral, narrow-channeled metazoan ALDH1/2 gave rise to large ALDH1 channels capable of accommodating bulky aldehydes, such as retinaldehyde, supporting the view that retinoid-dependent signaling arose from ancestral cellular detoxification mechanisms. Our analyses also indicate that, on a more restricted evolutionary scale, ALDH1 duplicates from invertebrate chordates (amphioxus and ascidian tunicates) underwent switches to smaller and narrower SECs. When combined with alterations in gene expression, these switches led to neofunctionalization from ALDH1-like roles in embryonic patterning to systemic, ALDH2-like roles, suggesting functional shifts from signaling to detoxification.
To compare the morphometry and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression of radial artery (RA) between young and elderly patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.
From February 2008 to June 2009, 219 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with autologous RA, 57 patients aged beyond 70 years and 64 patients aged under 60 years. Before RA was harvested, a modified Allen test was routinely performed. If positive, RA would be further evaluated with Doppler ultrasound examination. In both groups RA was collected for HE staining to evaluate percentage of luminal narrowing (LN) and relationship between intima and media width at maximum intimal thickness (IMR). Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to investigate the location and expression level of eNOS within the wall of RA.
Morphometry of RA in both young and elderly patients represented mild or moderate intimal hyperplasia, and medial calcification was not found. LN in elderly patients was (22 ± 6)%, while in young patients, it was (23 ± 6)%. IMR in elderly patients was 0.36 ± 0.21, while in young patients, it was 0.42 ± 0.19. There was no significant difference in both LN and IMR between two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Immunofluorescence indicated RA in both groups revealed a high expression of eNOS in intima and media, particularly in the smooth muscle of media. The values of relative integrated optical density in elderly patients was 1.21 ± 0.13, while in young patients, it was 1.25 ± 0.12. Also there was no significant difference in the expression level of eNOS within the wall of RA (P &gt; 0.05).
After preoperative assessment with modified Allen's test and Doppler analysis, RA used as graft in the elderly has similar quality and function with young patients, and it may lead to a high patency in long term.
We evaluated the reactivity of sera from Behçet's disease (BD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Takayasu's arteritis (TA) patients against human α-enolase and streptococcal α-enolase, and identified additional streptococcal antigens.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting were performed using sera from patients with BD, SLE, DM, RA, and TA and healthy volunteers (control) against human α-enolase and streptococcal α-enolase. Immunoblot analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to identify and recombine other streptococcal antigens.
Specific positive signals against recombinant human α-enolase were detected by IgM ELISA of serum samples from 50% of BD, 14.3% of SLE, 57.1% of DM, 42.9% of RA, and 57.1% of TA patients. Specific positive signals against streptococcal α-enolase were detected from 42.9% of BD, 14.3% of DM, and 14.3% of TA patients. No SLE and RA sera reacted against streptococcal α-enolase antigen. Streptococcal proteins reacting with sera were identified as hypothetical protein (HP) for SLE and DM patients, acid phosphatase (AP) for RA patients, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for TA patients.
We observed that RA patients did not present serum reactivity against either HP or GAPDH though BD, SLE, DM, and TA patients did. Also, AP reacted with sera from BD, SLE, DM, RA, and TA patients.
Formation of the early vertebrate embryo depends on a Brachyury/Wnt autoregulatory loop within the posterior mesodermal progenitors. We show that exogenous retinoic acid (RA), which dramatically truncates the embryo, represses expression of the zebrafish brachyury ortholog no tail (ntl), causing a failure to sustain the loop. We found that Ntl functions normally to protect the autoregulatory loop from endogenous RA by directly activating cyp26a1 expression. Thus, the embryonic mesodermal progenitors uniquely establish their own niche--with Brachyury being essential for creating a domain of high Wnt and low RA signaling--rather than having a niche created by separate support cells.
Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an often-used murine model for human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Earlier studies have shown potent anti-arthritic effects with the female sex hormone estradiol and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene in CIA in DBA/1-mice. B10.Q-ncf1*/*mice are B10.Q mice with a mutated Ncf1 gene. In B10.Q-ncf1*/*mice, CIA develops as a chronic relapsing disease, which more accurately mimics human RA. We investigated the role of endogenous and exogenous sex steroids and raloxifene in the course of this model of chronic arthritis. We also examined whether treatment would prevent the development of inflammation-triggered generalized osteoporosis.
Female B10.Q-ncf1*/*mice were sham-operated or ovariectomized, and CIA was induced. 22 days later, when 30% of the mice had developed arthritis, treatment with raloxifene, estradiol or vehicle was started, and the clinical disease was evaluated continuously. Treatment was continued until day 56 after immunization. At termination of the experiment (day 73), bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed, paws were collected for histological examination, and sera were analyzed for markers of cartilage turnover and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Raloxifene and estradiol treatment, as well as endogenous estrogen, decreased the frequency of arthritis, prevented joint destruction and countered generalized osteoporosis. These effects were associated with lower serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
This is the first study to show that raloxifene and estradiol can ameliorate established erosive arthritis and inflammation-triggered osteoporosis in this chronic arthritis model. We propose that treatment with raloxifene could be a beneficial addition to the treatment of postmenopausal RA.
Vax2 is an eye-specific homeobox gene, the inactivation of which in mouse leads to alterations in the establishment of a proper dorsoventral eye axis during embryonic development. To dissect the molecular pathways in which Vax2 is involved, we performed a transcriptome analysis of Vax2(-/-) mice throughout the main stages of eye development. We found that some of the enzymes involved in retinoic acid (RA) metabolism in the eye show significant variations of their expression levels in mutant mice. In particular, we detected an expansion of the expression domains of the RA-catabolizing enzymes Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1, and a downregulation of the RA-synthesizing enzyme Raldh3. These changes determine a significant expansion of the RA-free zone towards the ventral part of the eye. At postnatal stages of eye development, Vax2 inactivation led to alterations of the regional expression of the cone photoreceptor genes Opn1sw (S-Opsin) and Opn1mw (M-Opsin), which were significantly rescued after RA administration. We confirmed the above described alterations of gene expression in the Oryzias latipes (medaka fish) model system using both Vax2 gain- and loss-of-function assays. Finally, a detailed morphological and functional analysis of the adult retina in mutant mice revealed that Vax2 is necessary for intraretinal pathfinding of retinal ganglion cells in mammals. These data demonstrate for the first time that Vax2 is both necessary and sufficient for the control of intraretinal RA metabolism, which in turn contributes to the appropriate expression of cone opsins in the vertebrate eye.
Peroxisomal matrix protein is mainly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain tissues. To study the expression of peroxisomal protein (PEP) during neurogenesis, we employed mouse embryonic carcinoma cells (P19) and embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as an in vitro model for neural differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) induction. Expression pattern of PEP was investigated under distinct steps of differentiation by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The results revealed that expression of PEP transcripts was markedly increased after the RA treatment at embryoid body and neural stages. Therefore, we concluded that PEP might be involved in the early process of neurogenesis, which needs further verification.
Epicardial signaling and Rxra are required for expansion of the ventricular myocardial compact zone. Here, we examine Raldh2(-/-) and Rxra(-/-) mouse embryos to investigate the role of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in this developmental process. The heart phenotypes of Raldh2 and Rxra mutants are very similar and are characterized by a prominent defect in ventricular compact zone growth. Although RA activity is completely lost in Raldh2(-/-) epicardium and the adjacent myocardium, RA activity is not lost in Rxra(-/-) hearts, suggesting that RA signaling in the epicardium/myocardium is not required for myocardial compact zone formation. We explored the possibility that RA-mediated target gene transcription in non-cardiac tissues is required for this process. We found that hepatic expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a secreted factor implicated in myocardial expansion, is dependent on both Raldh2 and Rxra. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies support Epo as a direct target of RA signaling in embryonic liver. Treatment of an epicardial cell line with EPO, but not RA, upregulates Igf2. Furthermore, both Raldh2(-/-) and Rxra(-/-) hearts exhibit downregulation of Igf2 mRNA in the epicardium. EPO treatment of cultured Raldh2(-/-) hearts restores epicardial Igf2 expression and rescues ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation. We propose a new model for the mechanism of RA-mediated myocardial expansion in which RA directly induces hepatic Epo resulting in activation of epicardial Igf2 that stimulates compact zone growth. This RA-EPO-IGF2 signaling axis coordinates liver hematopoiesis with heart development.
The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that mice expressing mitochondrially targeted human glutathione reductase (GR) driven by a surfactant protein C promoter ((spc-mt)hGR) are functionally riboflavin deficient and that this deficiency exacerbates hyperoxic lung injury. The authors further hypothesized that dietary supplementation with riboflavin (FADH) will improve the bioactivity of GR, thus enhancing resistance to hyperoxic lung injury. Transgenic (mt-spc)hGR mice and their nontransgenic littermates were fed control or riboflavin-supplemented diets upon weaning. At 6 weeks of age the mice were exposed to either room air (RA) or &gt;95% O(2) for up to 84 hours. GR activities (with and without exogenous FADH) and GR protein levels were measured in lung tissue homogenates. Glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) concentrations were assayed to identify changes in GR activity in vivo. Lung injury was assessed by right lung to body weight ratios and bronchoalveolar lavage protein concentrations. The data showed that enhanced GR activity in the mitochondria of lung type II cells does not protect adult mice from hyperoxic lung injury. Furthermore, the addition of riboflavin to the diets of (spc-mt)hGR mice neither enhances GR activities nor offers protection from hyperoxic lung injury. The results indicated that modulation of mitochondrial GR activity in lung type II cells is not an effective therapy to minimize hyperoxic lung injury.
Candidate genes for the regulation of lifespan have emerged from studies that use mutants and genetically manipulated model organisms. However, it is rarely addressed whether these genes contribute to lifespan variation in populations of these species that capture natural standing genetic variation. Here, we explore expression variation in three candidate ageing genes, Indy, sod2, and catalase, in Bicyclus anynana, a butterfly with well understood ecology. We used lines established from natural populations and artificially selected for increased adult starvation resistance. They show a considerable increase in adult lifespan under both starvation and optimal food conditions. We measured adult butterflies of various ages, under a range of optimal and starvation diets, from two selected populations and one unselected control population. In all lines, Indy and catalase are up-regulated in response to starvation while this is not evident for sod2. Under starvation, Indy and catalase are up-regulated in, while this is not evident for sod2. Under optimal food conditions, Indy is down-regulated at a later age, with Indy expression showing relatively high inter-individual variation. We find differences between the selected lines and the unselected line. Under starvation conditions, expression is higher for catalase in one, and for sod2 in both selected lines. Importantly, sod2 expression is also higher in the selected populations under optimal food conditions. We conclude that sod2, but not Indy, is involved in the response to artificial selection for increased starvation resistance. The role of catalase is less clear because of the differences between the two selected lines. Moreover, sod2 appears to be a candidate gene that underpins the genetic correlation between starvation resistance and longevity. Our study indicates that some, but not all, genes identified through mutant screens in other organisms may underpin standing genetic variation for ageing-related traits in stocks of Bicyclus butterflies established from natural populations. Clearly, this needs to be investigated in other organisms as well, especially in the organisms to which mutants screens were applied. This information will narrow down the list of genes that underpin variation in lifespan and ageing in extant populations of organisms, and which may serve as candidate genes in humans.
We investigated the expression and localization of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in synovial fluid and synovial tissue, and examined the stimulation of HO-1 production in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Synovial fluid samples were obtained from knee joints of 20 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 20 osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and concentration of HO-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Synovial tissues obtained from RA or OA patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were used for immunohistochemical analysis of HO-1. HO-1 production by RASFs in response to various cytokines was examined by ELISA. HO-1 levels in synovial fluid were higher in the RA group than in the OA group with significant difference (P &lt; 0.001), and correlated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level (r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.01) in the RA group. Higher levels of HO-1 were seen in the RA-L group (Larsen grade III-V) than in the RA-E (Larsen grade 0-II) group (P &lt; 0.001). There was weak correlation between the levels of HO-1 protein and MMP-3 in synovial fluid in the RA group (r = 0.31, P &lt; 0.01), while no positive correlation was observed in OA. Positive immunoreaction for HO-1 was observed in cells of synovial tissue including synovial fibroblasts and cells in synovial pannus. HO-1 protein levels in cultured media of RASFs were increased by stimulation by interleukin-1β at 6 h and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at 12 h, but suppressed by interferon-gamma at 12 and 24 h. These results indicated that HO-1 expression in synovial tissue might be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines. The correlation of HO-1 concentration in synovial fluid with serum CRP and MMP-3 in joint fluid indicated that HO-1 might be useful as a marker of joint inflammation in RA patients.
The aim of this study was to determine the genetic regulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). DNase I hypersensitivity was used to identify potential hypersensitive sites (HS) across the MIF gene locus. Reporter gene assays were performed in different human cell lines with constructs containing the native or mutated HS element. Following phylogenetic and transcription factor binding profiling, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and RNA interference were performed and the effects of incubation with mithramycin, an antibiotic that binds GC boxes, were also studied. An HS centred on the first intron of MIF was identified. The HS acted as an enhancer in human T lymphoblasts (CEMC7A), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and human monocytic cells (THP-1), but not in a fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) cell line (SW982) or cultured FLS derived from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Two cis-elements within the first intron were found to be responsible for the enhancer activity. Mutation of the consensus Sp1 GC box on each cis-element abrogated enhancer activity and EMSA indicated Sp1 binding to one of the cis-elements contained in the intron. SiRNA knock-down of Sp1 alone or Sp1 and Sp3 together was incomplete and did not alter the enhancer activity. Mithramycin inhibited expression of MIF in CEMC7A cells. This effect was specific to the intronic enhancer and was not seen on the MIF promoter. These results identify a novel, cell type-specific enhancer of MIF. The enhancer appears to be driven by Sp1 or related Sp family members and is highly sensitive to inhibition via mithramycin.
The C-type lectin receptor DCIR, which has been shown very recently to act as an attachment factor for HIV-1 in dendritic cells, is expressed predominantly on antigen-presenting cells. However, this concept was recently challenged by the discovery that DCIR can also be detected in CD4(+) T cells found in the synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Given that RA and HIV-1 infections share common features such as a chronic inflammatory condition and polyclonal immune hyperactivation status, we hypothesized that HIV-1 could promote DCIR expression in CD4(+) T cells. We report here that HIV-1 drives DCIR expression in human primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from patients (from both aviremic/treated and viremic/treatment naive persons) and cells acutely infected in vitro (seen in both virus-infected and uninfected cells). Soluble factors produced by virus-infected cells are responsible for the noticed DCIR up-regulation on uninfected cells. Infection studies with Vpr- or Nef-deleted viruses revealed that these two viral genes are not contributing to the mechanism of DCIR induction that is seen following acute infection of CD4(+) T cells with HIV-1. Moreover, we report that DCIR is linked to caspase-dependent (induced by a mitochondria-mediated generation of free radicals) and -independent intrinsic apoptotic pathways (involving the death effector AIF). Finally, we demonstrate that the higher surface expression of DCIR in CD4(+) T cells is accompanied by an enhancement of virus attachment/entry, replication and transfer. This study shows for the first time that HIV-1 induces DCIR membrane expression in CD4(+) T cells, a process that might promote virus dissemination throughout the infected organism.
Activin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, is an important modulator of FSH synthesis and secretion and is involved in reproductive dysfunctions and cancers. It also regulates ovarian follicle development. To understand the mechanisms and pathways by which activin regulates follicle function, we performed a microarray study and identified 240 activin regulated genes in mouse granulosa cells. The gene most strongly inhibited by activin was Cyp26b1, which encodes a P450 cytochrome enzyme that degrades retinoic acid (RA). Cyp26b1 has been shown to play an important role in male germ cell meiosis, but its expression is largely lost in the ovary around embryonic d 12.5. This study demonstrated that Cyp26b1 mRNA was expressed in granulosa cells of follicles at all postnatal developmental stages. A striking inverse spatial and temporal correlation between Cyp26b1 and activin-βA mRNA expression was observed. Cyp26b1 expression was also elevated in a transgenic mouse model that has decreased activin expression. The Cyp26 inhibitor R115866 stimulated the proliferation of primary cultured mouse granulosa cells, and a similar effect was observed with RA and activin. A pan-RA receptor inhibitor, AGN194310, abolished the stimulatory effect of either RA or activin on granulosa cell proliferation, indicating an involvement of RA receptor-mediated signaling. Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of activin action in the ovary. We conclude that Cyp26b1 is expressed in the postnatal mouse ovary, regulated by activin, and involved in the control of granulosa cell proliferation.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation. It has been suggested that the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in patients with RA is higher than in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the level of the lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px), level of the -SH groups and GSH and Na(+)K(+) ATPase activity in erythrocytes from patients with RA. There are no significant differences in CAT and GSH-Px activities. SOD activity is lower in RA patients than in the control group. Increase in the lipid peroxidation is observed in RA patients. Levels of the GHS and -SH groups are significantly lower in RA patients than in the control groups. Total ATPase and Na(+)K(+) ATPase activities decrease in RA patients.
Vitamin A (retinol) is an essential precursor for the production of retinoic acid (RA), which in turn is a major regulator of gene expression, affecting cell differentiation throughout the body. Understanding how vitamin A nutritional status, as well as therapeutic retinoid treatment, regulates the expression of retinoid homeostatic genes is important for improvement of dietary recommendations and therapeutic strategies using retinoids. This study investigated genes central to processes of retinoid uptake and storage, release to plasma, and oxidation in the liver of rats under steady-state conditions after different exposures to dietary vitamin A (deficient, marginal, adequate, and supplemented) and acutely after administration of a therapeutic dose of all-trans-RA. Over a very wide range of dietary vitamin A, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) as well as multiple cytochrome P-450s (CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP2C22) differed by diet and were highly correlated with one another and with vitamin A status assessed by liver retinol concentration (all correlations, P &lt; 0.05). After acute treatment with RA, the same genes were rapidly and concomitantly induced, preceding retinoic acid receptor (RAR)β, a classical direct target of RA. CYP26A1 mRNA exhibited the greatest dynamic range (change of log 2(6) in 3 h). Moreover, CYP26A1 increased more rapidly in the liver of RA-primed rats than naive rats, evidenced by increased CYP26A1 gene expression and increased conversion of [(3)H]RA to polar metabolites. By in situ hybridization, CYP26A1 mRNA was strongly regulated within hepatocytes, closely resembling retinol-binding protein (RBP)4 in location. Overall, whether RA is produced endogenously from retinol or administered exogenously, changes in retinoid homeostatic gene expression simultaneously favor both retinol esterification and RA oxidation, with CYP26A1 exhibiting the greatest dynamic change.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a known teratogen that is also required endogenously for normal development of the embryo. RA can act as a morphogen, through direct binding to receptors and RA response elements in the genome, and classical studies of limb development and regeneration in amphibians have shown that it is likely to provide positional information. Availability of RA depends on both metabolic synthesis and catabolic degradation, and specific binding proteins act to further modulate the binding of RA to response elements. Here, we describe the expression of seven genes involved in metabolism (Raldh1-3), catabolism (Cyp26a and b) and binding of RA (Crabp1 and 2) during organogenesis in the clawed frog Xenopus laevis. Taken together, this data indicates regions of the embryo that could be affected by RA mediated patterning, and identifies some differences with other vertebrates.
Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound found in various plant families. We previously reported that RA exerted protective effects against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity through antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated whether RA could prevent effects of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced insult in MES23.5 dopamineric cells. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treatment decreased cell viability and dopamine content, as well as caused apoptotic morphological changes. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by inhibition of activity associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, suggested mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapse and generation of reactive oxygen species. Decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase 3 activation were also observed. Rosmarinic acid pretreatment restored the complex I activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and partially reversed the other damaging effects of MPP(+). Our results indicate that RA plays a neuroprotective role by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction against MPP(+)-induced cell apoptosis and suggest that RA has the potential to be considered an aid for prevention of Parkinson's disease.
It is unknown how dendritic cells (DCs) become specialized as mucosal DCs and maintain intestinal homeostasis. We report that a subset of bone marrow cells freshly isolated from C57BL/6 mice express the retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2 (ALDH1a2) and are capable of providing RA to DC precursors in the bone marrow microenvironment. RA induced bone marrow-derived DCs to express CCR9 and ALDH1a2 and conferred upon them mucosal DC functions, including induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, IgA-secreting B cells, and gut-homing molecules. This response of DCs to RA was dependent on a narrow time window and stringent dose effect. RA promoted bone marrow-derived DC production of bioactive TGF-β by inhibiting suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression and thereby enhancing STAT3 activation. These RA effects were evident in vivo, in that mucosal DCs from vitamin A-deficient mice had reduced mucosal DC function, namely failure to induce Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Furthermore, MyD88 signaling enhanced RA-educated DC ALDH1a2 expression and was required for optimal TGF-β production. These data indicate that RA plays a critical role in the generation of mucosal DCs from bone marrow and in their functional activity.
Carcinogen-DNA adducts could lead to mutations in critical genes, eventually resulting in cancer. Many studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in inducing cell apoptosis. Here we have tested the hypothesis that levels of carcinogen-DNA adducts can be diminished by DNA repair and/or by eliminating damaged cells through apoptosis. Our results showed that the levels of total DNA adducts in HepG2 cells treated with benzo(a)pyrene (BP, 2 μM)+RA (1 μM) were significantly reduced compared to those treated with BP only (P=0.038). In order to understand the mechanism of attenuation of DNA adducts, further experiments were performed. Cells were treated with BP (4 μM) for 24h to initiate DNA adduct formation, following which the medium containing BP was removed, and fresh medium containing 1 μM RA was added. The cells were harvested 24h after RA treatment. Interestingly, the levels of total DNA adducts were lower in the BP/RA group (390 ± 34) than those in the BP/DMSO group (544 ± 33), P=0.032. Analysis of cell apoptosis showed an increase in BP+RA group, compared to BP or RA only groups. Our results also indicated that attenuation of BP-DNA adducts by RA was not primarily due to its effects on CYP1A1 expression. In conclusion, our results suggest a mechanistic link between cellular apoptosis and DNA adduct formation, phenomena that play important roles in BP-mediated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, these results help understand the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, especially in relation to the chemopreventive properties of nutritional apoptosis inducers.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) against myeloperoxidase (MPO), proteinase 3 (PR-3), lactoferrin (LF), cathepsin G (CG) and elastase (EL) were determined to investigate whether the presence of ANCAs is closely related to extra-articular manifestations in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Antibodies against MPO, PR-3, LF, CG and EL were determined in sera from 125 patients with RA and 83 sera from patients with other rheumatic diseases by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters of the patients were studied from medical records. Thirty of the 125 (24.0%) RA patients were positive for ANCAs for at least one of these 5 ANCA antigens. Among the 5 ANCAs, anti-LF antibody (anti-LF) (16.8%) was most commonly observed in patients with RA. A higher joint score (JS) and an elevated ESR were demonstrated in ANCA-positive RA patients compared to those of ANCA-negative patients (40.8 ± 43.3, 24.3 ± 26.2, p &lt; 0.05, 44.4 ± 22.4, 28.9 ± 23.6, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). No statistical differences in the presence of interstitial pneumonia, cutaneous vasculitis, rheumatoid nodules and mononeuropathy multiplex were observed between ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative patients. The presence of anti-LF is expected to be of pathological relevance, as the action of anti-LF towards LF results in the inhibition of the anti-inflammatory activity of LF.
To determine whether 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133C/T, rs1801131A/C, rs2274976A/G, rs2066462C/T genetic polymorphisms are associated with clinical response and adverse effects (AEs) of methotrexate (MTX) treatment in Chinese Han patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
One hundred and ten RA patients defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised criteria were involved in this study. All patients were treated with low-dose MTX (10-15 mg/week) without concomitant uses of other DMARDs. Clinical response (using ACR20 criteria) and AEs were evaluated at 0, 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks. The genotypes of MTHFR rs1801133C/T, rs1801131A/C, rs2274976A/G and rs2066462C/T were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR.
The allele frequency of rs1801131C in the clinical response group was higher than in the non-response group (21.0% vs. 8.1%, p&lt;0.05), and the patients with CC or AC genotype had greater clinical response than those with AA genotype. The allele frequencies of rs1801133T and rs2274976A were higher in the group with AEs than that without AEs (56.4% vs. 37.5% and 14.9% vs. 4.2%, respectively, both p&lt;0.05). The patients with CT or TT genotype in rs1801133 had higher risks of AEs than those with CC genotype.
While rs1801131A/C genetic polymorphism is associated with the clinical response, rs1801133C/T and rs2274976A/G genetic polymorphisms are associated with MTX-related AEs in the treatment of RA. This suggests individualisation is necessary to achieve optimal outcomes in MTX therapy of RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) induces embryonic stem cell differentiation. The effects of RA are mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) that promote epigenetic changes controlling gene transcription. We show here that RARγ, in the absence of the ligand RA, is required for deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and the polycomb group protein Suz12 at RA target genes, and that in embryonic stem cells both RARγ and Suz12 exist in a multi-protein complex in the absence of ligand. Addition of RA causes removal of H2A.Z and Suz12 from RARγ target genes when the genes are transcriptionally activated.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a pleiotropic derivative of vitamin A, or retinol, which is responsible for all of the bioactivity associated with this vitamin. The teratogenic influences of vitamin A deficiency and excess RA in rodents were first observed more than 50 years ago. Efforts over the last 15-20 years have refined these observations by defining the molecular mechanisms that control RA availability and signaling during murine embryonic development. This review will discuss our current understanding of the role of RA in teratogenesis, with specific emphasis on the essential function of the RA catabolic CYP26 enzymes in preventing teratogenic consequences caused by uncontrolled distribution of RA. Particular focus will be paid to the RA-sensitive tissues of the caudal and cranial regions, the limb, and the testis, and how genetic mutation of factors controlling RA distribution have revealed important roles for RA during embryogenesis.
In our previous study, we have demonstrated that (Z)-5-(4-methoxybenzylidene) thiazolidine-2, 4-dione (SKLB010), a novel analogue of thiazolidinediones, showed protection against concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis via inhibiting the migration of macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. In present study, Transwell assay was applied to study the effects of SKLB010 on macrophage-like Raw264.7 cell migration and we investigated the effects of SKLB010 on NO generation in vitro. We also studied in vivo effects of SKLB010 on adjuvant-induced arthritis in Lewis rats by oral administration. It was proved that SKLB010 depressed cells migration and the production of NO in Raw264.7 cells in a dose-dependent way. Our results also indicated that oral administration of 50 mg/kg SKLB010 markedly resulted in a clear suppression of clinical signs compared to untreated groups, showing as markedly reduction of paw swelling and inhibition of body weight decreasing. The improvement in disease severity was accompanied by suppression of CD68-positive cells in knee joint and by inhibition of production in pro-inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in serum. The elevated TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS mRNA expression in tissue were down-regulated after treatment with SKLB010. SKLB010 also significantly inhibited the histological progress of RA. These data indicate that SKLB010 is a potent anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent targeting the inflammatory response of macrophages.
Sex determination of mammalian germ cells occurs during fetal development and depends on signals from gonadal somatic cells. Previous studies have established that retinoic acid (RA) triggers ovarian germ cells to enter meiosis and thereby commit to oogenesis, whereas in the developing testis, the enzyme CYP26B1 degrades RA and germ cells are not induced to enter meiosis. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) produced in the fetal testis acts directly on germ cells to inhibit meiosis; in addition, FGF9 maintains expression of pluripotency-related genes and upregulates markers associated with male germ cell fate. We conclude that two independent and mutually antagonistic pathways involving RA and FGF9 act in concert to determine mammalian germ cell sexual fate commitment and support a model in which the mitosis/meiosis switch is robustly controlled by both positive and negative regulatory factors.
In the central nervous system inflammation is mediated by microglia and astrocytes. To investigate its regulation, murine astrocyte cultures were treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and analyzed with Affymetrix gene array, qRT-PCR and ELISA. Cells responded to LPS with a strong upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Treatment with the transcriptional activator retinoic acid (RA) suppressed mRNA expression and protein release of several important cytokines (IL-1β 4%, IL-6 21%, TNFα 30%, IL-12p40 42%, and IL-12p35/p40 27%; p&lt;0.01). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that all-trans RA takes part in endogenous anti-inflammatory feedback loops in the CNS.
Mice deficient in growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) signaling display anterior transformation of axial vertebrae and truncation of caudal vertebrae. However, the in vivo molecular mechanisms by which GDF11 signaling regulates the development of the vertebral column have yet to be determined. We found that Gdf11 and Acvr2b mutants are sensitive to exogenous RA treatment on vertebral specification and caudal vertebral development. We show that diminished expression of Cyp26a1, a retinoic acid inactivating enzyme, and concomitant elevation of retinoic acid activity in the caudal region of Gdf11(-/-) embryos may account for this phenomenon. Reduced expression or function of Cyp26a1 enhanced anterior transformation of axial vertebrae in wild-type and Acvr2b mutants. Furthermore, a pan retinoic acid receptor antagonist (AGN193109) could lessen the anterior transformation phenotype and rescue the tail truncation phenotype of Gdf11(-/-) mice. Taken together, these results suggest that GDF11 signaling regulates development of caudal vertebrae and is involved in specification of axial vertebrae in part by maintaining Cyp26a1 expression, which represses retinoic acid activity in the caudal region of embryos during the somitogenesis stage.
The anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory effects of dipyridamole and the possible involvement of NO in the dipyridamole action are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dipyridamole alone and in combination with either the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NG- monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA), on pathogenesis of adjuvant-induced arthritis model in rats. The results of the present work showed that prophylactic administration of dipyridamole alone and dipyridamole administration in combination with either low dose of SNP or L-NMMA significantly ameliorated pathogenesis of adjuvant arthritis in rats as evidenced by significant decrease in arthritis index, hind paws volume, loss of body weight, hyperalgesia compared with control vehicle (1% DMSO) treated adjuvant arthritic rats. Inflammatory cellular infiltrate in synovium of ankle joint and pannus formation were also markedly inhibited. Interleukin-10(IL-10) levels were significantly increased in these groups of animals. In contrast, a high dose of SNP counteracted the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of dipyridamole. The inhibitory effect of therapeutic administration of dipyridamole alone on adjuvant arthritis syndrome was not significantly different from that of vehicle administration. In conclusion, dipyridamole has prophylactic but not therapeutic anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory effects that appear to be dependent on inhibition of NO synthase. A synergistic combination between dipyridamole and NO synthase inhibitor or low dose of NO donor may have prophylactic and therapeutic values in autoimmune diseases like RA.
The molecular mechanism(s) controlling cell migration during vascular morphogenesis in vivo remain largely undefined. To address this within a physiological context, we used retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) null mouse embryos and demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) deficiency results in abnormal yolk sac vascular remodeling due to decreased Rac1 activation, increased RhoA activation, and increased focal adhesions. Vinculin was increased in Raldh2-/- yolk sacs, and molecular events important for focal adhesion turnover, FAK phosphorylation (Tyr397) and FAK-paxillin association, were decreased. RA-rescue of vascular remodeling down-regulated vinculin and restored FAK phosphorylation (Tyr397) and FAK-paxillin association. Furthermore, vascular rescue with vascular endothelial growth factor-A, Indian hedgehog, and basic fibroblast growth factor restored FAK phosphorylation (Tyr397) in the endothelium of Raldh2-/- yolk sacs. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of endothelial cell migration during vascular remodeling in vivo by adding the Rac1 and FAK activation pathway as a critical mediator of focal adhesion formation and turnover during vascular remodeling.
Nolz1 is a zinc finger transcription factor whose expression is enriched in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE), although its function is still unknown.
Here we analyze the role of Nolz1 during LGE development. We show that Nolz1 expression is high in proliferating neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of the LGE subventricular zone. In addition, low levels of Nolz1 are detected in the mantle zone, as well as in the adult striatum. Similarly, Nolz1 is highly expressed in proliferating LGE-derived NPC cultures, but its levels rapidly decrease upon cell differentiation, pointing to a role of Nolz1 in the control of NPC proliferation and/or differentiation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we find that Nolz1 over-expression promotes cell cycle exit of NPCs in neurosphere cultures and negatively regulates proliferation in telencephalic organotypic cultures. Within LGE primary cultures, Nolz1 over-expression promotes the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype, since it increases the number of β-III tubulin (Tuj1)- and microtubule-associated protein (MAP)2-positive neurons, and inhibits astrocyte generation and/or differentiation. Retinoic acid (RA) is one of the most important morphogens involved in striatal neurogenesis, and regulates Nolz1 expression in different systems. Here we show that Nolz1 also responds to this morphogen in E12.5 LGE-derived cell cultures. However, Nolz1 expression is not regulated by RA in E14.5 LGE-derived cell cultures, nor is it affected during LGE development in mouse models that present decreased RA levels. Interestingly, we find that Gsx2, which is necessary for normal RA signaling during LGE development, is also required for Nolz1 expression, which is lost in Gsx2 knockout mice. These findings suggest that Nolz1 might act downstream of Gsx2 to regulate RA-induced neurogenesis. Keeping with this hypothesis, we show that Nolz1 induces the selective expression of the RA receptor (RAR)β without altering RARα or RARγ. In addition, Nozl1 over-expression increases RA signaling since it stimulates the RA response element. This RA signaling is essential for Nolz1-induced neurogenesis, which is impaired in a RA-free environment or in the presence of a RAR inverse agonist. It has been proposed that Drosophila Gsx2 and Nolz1 homologues could cooperate with the transcriptional co-repressors Groucho-TLE to regulate cell proliferation. In agreement with this view, we show that Nolz1 could act in collaboration with TLE-4, as they are expressed at the same time in NPC cultures and during mouse development.
Nolz1 promotes RA signaling in the LGE, contributing to the striatal neurogenesis during development.
Retinoids are regulators of keratinocyte differentiation in the epidermis and important therapeutics in dermatology. The formation of the most active retinoid, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) by oxidation of retinal is catalyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), of which ALDH1A3 has been shown to be most efficient. Here we investigated the expression of ALDH1A3 in epidermal cultures. Three alternatively spliced mRNAs of ALDH1A3 were detected in skin cultures with the conventionally spliced mRNA being predominant. Among a panel of ALDH genes, only ALDH1A3 was upregulated by RA in primary keratinocytes. RA increased the expression of ALDH1A3 also in organotypic human skin cultures and in an epidermal explant in vitro whereas no upregulation was detected in dermal fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Our results indicate that the regulation of the retinoic acid metabolism in the epidermis involves transcriptional activation of ALDH1A3, possibly representing a positive feedback loop, which enhances the effect of exogenous RA.
In mammals, early fetal germ cells are unique in their ability to initiate the spermatogenesis or oogenesis programs dependent of their somatic environment. In mice, female germ cells enter into meiosis at 13.5 dpc whereas in the male, germ cells undergo mitotic arrest. Recent findings indicate that Cyp26b1, a RA-degrading enzyme, is a key factor preventing initiation of meiosis in the fetal testis. Here, we report evidence for additional testicular pathways involved in the prevention of fetal meiosis. Using a co-culture model in which an undifferentiated XX gonad is cultured with a fetal or neonatal testis, we demonstrated that the testis prevented the initiation of meiosis and induced male germ cell differentiation in the XX gonad. This testicular effect disappeared when male meiosis starts in the neonatal testis and was not directly due to Cyp26b1 expression. Moreover, neither RA nor ketoconazole, an inhibitor of Cyp26b1, completely prevented testicular inhibition of meiosis in co-cultured ovary. We found that secreted factor(s), with molecular weight greater than 10 kDa contained in conditioned media from cultured fetal testes, inhibited meiosis in the XX gonad. Lastly, although both Sertoli and interstitial cells inhibited meiosis in XX germ cells, only interstitial cells induced mitotic arrest in germ cell. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that male germ cell determination is supported by additional non-retinoid secreted factors inhibiting both meiosis and mitosis and produced by the testicular somatic cells during fetal and neonatal life.
Lanthanide tags offer the opportunity to retrieve long-range distance information from NMR experiments that can be used to guide protein docking. To determine whether sufficient restraints can be retrieved for proteins with low solubility and availability, Ln tags were applied in the study of the 65 kDa membrane-associated protein complex formed by the electron carrier adrenodoxin and its electron donor, adrenodoxin reductase. The reductase is only monomeric at low concentration, and the paramagnetic iron-sulfur cluster of adrenodoxin broadens many of the resonances of nuclei in the interface. Guided by the paramagnetic restraints obtained using two Ln-tag attachment sites, protein docking yields a cluster of solutions with an rmsd of 3.2 A. The mean structure is close to the crystal structure of the cross-linked complex, with an rmsd of 4.0 A. It is concluded that with the application of Ln tags paramagnetic NMR restraints for structure determination can be retrieved even for difficult, low-concentration protein complexes.
To examine interactions between fish oil and paracetamol for inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Patients from an early RA clinic who were treated with a standardized combination DMARD regimen were enrolled. They were advised to consume an anti-inflammatory dose of fish oil containing the n-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or a comparator oil. High EPA and Low EPA groups were defined by blood EPA levels &gt;3.5% or &lt;2%, respectively, of plasma phospholipid fatty acids. Participants provided a blood sample before, and 1h after ingestion of 1g paracetamol. The blood was incubated in different ways to allow measurement of COX-2 generated prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and COX-1 generated thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)).
Paracetamol suppressed the eicosanoid measures of COX-1 and COX-2 activities and the suppression was greater in the High EPA group. The results indicate that the combination of fish oil and paracetamol suppresses PGE(2) synthesis by an amount equivalent to that from maximum therapeutic doses of NSAIDs.
Paracetamol is recommended for first-line use ahead of NSAIDs for symptom relief in RA or OA. Combining paracetamol with fish oil will enhance suppression of nociceptive PGE(2) synthesis and thereby may provide additive symptomatic benefits.
CYP26A1, which catalyzes the oxidation of all-trans (at)-retinoic acid (RA), is induced moderately by RA in numerous tissues, but is highly responsive in liver. To understand this difference, we have examined the CYP26A1 gene sequence, identified multiple RA response elements (RAREs) and tested them functionally in HepG2 cells as model hepatocytes, and in the liver of vitamin A (VA)-adequate and -deficient rats. Analysis of a 2.2 kbp 5'-flanking region upstream of the CYP26A1 transcription start site (TSS) identified 3 conserved hexameric direct repeat-5 elements, RARE1, -2 and -3, and a half site, RARE4. The full-length promoter containing all 4 elements was sufficient and necessary to increase promoter activity similar to levels of endogenous CYP26A1 mRNA produced in HepG2 cells treated with at-RA. In DNA binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, the binding of RARs to the proximal RARE1 and distal RARE2, -3, and -4 regions of the CYP26A1 promoter was increased in RA-treated HepG2 cells, and greater in VA-sufficient than VA-deficient liver. Moreover, RA increased the binding of RNA polymerase-II in the distal as well as the proximal region, indicating that the distal region may be looped to become positioned close to the TSS, a process favored by retinoic acid receptors. The results support a cooperative model in which the functioning of multiple RAREs may account for the strong inducibility of CYP26A1 in liver, which, in turn, may be important physiologically for restoring retinoid homeostasis when the concentration of RA rises.
Recent experimental studies have confirmed a long-held view that protein complex formation proceeds via a short-lived encounter state. The population of this transient intermediate, stabilized mainly by long-range electrostatic interactions, varies among different complexes. Here we show that the occupancy of the encounter state can be modulated across a broad range by single point mutations of interfacial residues. Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy, we illustrate that it is possible to both enhance and diminish the binding specificity in an electron transfer complex of yeast cytochrome c (Cc) and cytochrome c peroxidase. The Cc T12A mutation decreases the population of the encounter to 10% as compared with 30% in the wild-type complex. More dramatically, the Cc R13A substitution reverses the relative occupancies of the stereospecific and the encounter forms, with the latter now being the dominant species with the population of 80%. This finding indicates that the encounter state can make a large contribution to the stability of a protein complex. Also, it appears that by adjusting the amount of the encounter through a judicious choice of point mutations, we can remodel the energy landscape of a protein complex and tune its binding specificity.
The initiation of meiosis is crucial to fertility. While extensive studies in rodents have enhanced our understanding of this process, studies in human fetal ovary are lacking.
We used RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to investigate expression of meiotic factors in human fetal ovaries from 6 to 15 weeks post fertilization (wpf) and developed an organ culture model to study the initiation of human meiosis.
We observed the first meiotic cells at 11 wpf, when STRA8, SPO11 and DMC1 are first expressed. In culture, meiosis initiation is observed in 10 and 11 wpf ovaries and meiosis is maintained by addition of fetal calf serum. Meiosis is stimulated, compared with control, by retinoic acid (RA) (P &lt; 0.05). No major change occurred in mRNA for CYP26B1, the RA-degrading enzyme proposed to control the timing of meiosis in mice. We did, however, observe increased mRNA levels for ALDH1A1 in human ovary when meiosis began, and evidence for a requirement to synthesize RA and thus sustain meiosis. Indeed, ALDH inhibition by citral prevented the appearance of meiotic cells. Finally, 8 wpf ovaries (and earlier stages) were unable to initiate meiosis whatever the length of culture, even in the presence of RA and serum. However, when human germ cells from 8 wpf ovaries were placed in a mouse ovarian environment, some did initiate meiosis.
Our data indicate that meiosis initiation in the human ovary relies partially on RA, but that the progression and regulation of this process appears to differ in many aspects from that described in mice.
Acute and chronic abuses of psychostimulant drugs such as methamphetamine (METH) have been known to cause cell death. In particular, neurotoxicity caused by such drugs is one of the most serious adverse events in humans. Although various effects on neuronal cells caused by METH have been studied, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of METH-induced neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated. To investigate the mechanism of METH-induced cytotoxicity, we studied cytological as well as biochemical changes in retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Marked cell death was observed with more than 7mM METH, although caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death was not observed with any concentration of METH treatment. The most prominent cytomorphological effect by METH was the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles which were not colocalized with either GFP-LC3 or HSP47-GFP, autophagosome and ER markers respectively. In contrast, many of these vacuoles incorporated large molecular weight FITC-dextran and were confirmed as macropinosomes. Our results indicate that METH-induced cytomorphological effects on RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells involve macropinocytosis and the hyperstimulation of this process may be involved in METH-caused cytotoxicity.
Throughout the reproductive lifespan of most male mammals, sperm production is constant because of the regulated differentiation of spermatogonia. Retinoic acid (RA) and a downstream target, Stra8, are required for complete spermatogenesis. To examine the role of RA in initiating spermatogonial differentiation, a transgenic mouse model expressing beta-galactosidase under the control of an RA response element was used. Cells in the neonatal testis undergoing active RA signaling were visualized by beta-galactosidase activity, the relationship between RA and differentiation determined, and the role of RA-degrading enzymes in regulating RA demonstrated. Beta-galactosidase activity was found to be predominantly associated with differentiating, premeiotic germ cells and to be distributed nonuniformly throughout the seminiferous tubules. Additionally, beta-galactosidase activity in premeiotic germ cells colocalized with STRA8 protein and was induced in germ cells with exogenous RA treatment. The RA-degrading enzyme, CYP26B1, was found to have germ cell localization and nonuniform distribution between tubules via immunohistochemistry. Treatment with a CYP26 enzyme inhibitor resulted in an increased number of germ cells with both beta-galactosidase activity and STRA8 protein and an increase in the expression of genes associated with differentiation and reduced expression of a gene associated with undifferentiated germ cells. These results show the action of RA in a subset of spermatogonia leads to nonuniform initiation of differentiation throughout the neonatal testis, potentially mediated through the action of CYP26 enzymes. Thus, the presence of RA is a likely driving factor in the initiation of spermatogonial differentiation and may result in asynchronous spermatogenesis.
Previously, we documented the co-expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and protein kinase C-eta (PKC-eta) in peripheral blood-derived macrophages (PBDM) from moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with elevated plasma nitric oxide levels but not from those with non-inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA) or normal plasma NO levels. The presence of PKC-eta was found to be required before macrophages could acquire the NOS2-positive phenotype and make copious levels of NO. In the current study, we report the divergent effects of two biological-based RA therapies which target TNFalpha function (infliximab) or IL1 response (anakinra) on the development of the NOS2-positive phenotype by PBDM in patients with refractory RA. Both infliximab and anakinra were effective in improving disease symptoms. However, treatment with anakinra, but not infliximab led to a complete suppression of NOS2 expression in PBDM and consequently, a more pronounced reduction in plasma NO levels. Data also revealed a requirement of both TNF-alpha and IL-1 in the development of the NOS2-positive macrophage phenotype. Finally, the data have shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which NO production may be regulated during disease progression to severe RA, and thus, offer a novel insight into the identification of future therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
Ever since the first use of cortisone, glucocorticoids have had a controversial role in the treatment of RA. There has been equally controversial research into the possible involvement of endogenous glucocorticoids, and their secretion via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in the development and persistence of inflammatory arthritis. Recently, our understanding of how glucocorticoids act has expanded substantially with the characterization of glucocorticoid-metabolizing enzymes that regulate glucocorticoid action at tissue level. These enzymes, the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, interconvert biologically inactive glucocorticoids such as cortisone and prednisone with their active counterparts, cortisol (hydrocortisone) and prednisolone. Without these enzymes, cortisone and prednisone would be therapeutically useless. Furthermore, in normal individuals, the activities of these enzymes influence the function of other components of the HPA axis. These enzymes are expressed in human synovial tissue and bone and have been implicated in the control of synovial inflammation, the development of periarticular bone loss and the sensitivity of bone to therapeutic glucocorticoids. This article reviews recent findings in this area that highlight the role of these enzymes in rheumatic diseases.
Genome-wide association studies carried out in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have led to the discovery of several genetic associations with this disease. Still, the current associated genetic variations can explain only part of the genetic risk involved in RA, and it is well recognized that these genome-wide association studies are likely underpowered to detect all common disease variants. This study was undertaken to explore the genomic regions showing low-significance associations in previous genome-wide association studies of RA.
To reduce the false-positive signal fraction, we exploited pathway analysis to prioritize regions containing genes most likely to be implicated in RA. We hypothesized that true disease genes would be in a similar pathway. Therefore, genes from similar pathways but located in different regions were prioritized for replication using Prioritizer software. A total of 384 genetic variants selected from previous RA genome-wide association studies were tested in a Spanish case-control discovery cohort comprising 376 RA patients and 478 healthy controls for replication. Statistically significant associations were further validated in replication cohorts from Spain and The Netherlands. The study consisted of a total of 1,818 RA patients and 2,498 controls.
We detected a novel genetic association between RA and the MSRA gene (rs10903323) in the Spanish combined population (P = 2.91 × 10(-5) , odds ratio [OR] 1.51). This association was further tested in our independent Dutch replication cohort. Combined analysis showed an overall association of MSRA with RA (P = 3.19 × 10(-4) , OR 1.28).
Our findings indicate that a novel association in the MSRA gene is related to oxidative stress and support the notion of a major role for this process in RA.
Previous observational studies reported that concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated whether H(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) is an alternative to PPI in patients with ACS.
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of 6552 patients in Taiwan discharged for ACS between 2002 and 2005. Patients were divided into 5 cohorts: clopidogrel plus H(2)RA (n = 252), clopidogrel plus PPI (n = 311), clopidogrel alone (n = 5551), H(2)RA alone (n = 235), and PPI alone (n = 203). The primary outcome was rehospitalization for ACS or all-cause mortality within 3 month of rehospitalization.
The 1-year cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 26.8% (95% CI: 21.5%-33.0%) in the clopidogrel plus H(2)RA cohort and 33.2% (95% CI: 27.8%-39.4%) in the clopidogrel plus PPI cohort, compared with 11.6% (95% CI: 10.8%-12.5%) in the clopidogrel alone cohort (P &lt; .0001). No significant difference was observed between the PPI alone cohort (11.0%; 95% CI: 7.1%-16.8%), the H(2)RA alone cohort (11.8%; 95% CI: 8.2%-16.8%), and the clopidogrel alone cohort in terms of the primary outcome. The number needed to harm was 7 with concomitant H(2)RA and 5 with concomitant PPI. On multivariate analysis, concomitant H(2)RA and PPI were independent risk factors predicting adverse outcomes (adjusted hazard ratios, 2.48 and 3.20, respectively; P &lt; .0001).
Concomitant use of clopidogrel and H(2)RA or PPI after hospital discharge for ACS is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.
To investigate the role of Rosmarinic acid (RA) in the prevention of traumatic brain injury and the immunohistochemical analysis of IBA-1 and GFAP expressions.
Healthy male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups consisting of 10 rats. Groups were as follows; control group, traumatic brain injury (TBI) group, and TBI+RA group. After traumatic brain injury, blood samples were taken from the animals and analyzed with various biochemical markers. And then IBA-1 and GFAP expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically.
Significant results were obtained in all biochemical parameters between groups. Immunohistochemical sections showed IBA-1 not only in microglia and macrophage activity but also in degenerative neurons in blood vessel endothelial cells. However, GFAP reaction and post-traumatic rosmarinic acid administration showed positive expression in astrocytes with regular structure around the blood vessel.
Rosmarinic acid in blood vessel endothelial cells showed that preserving the integrity of astrocytic structure in the blood brain barrier may be an important antioxidant.
Developmental progression depends on temporally defined changes in gene expression mediated by transient exposure of lineage intermediates to signals in the progenitor niche. To determine whether cell-intrinsic epigenetic mechanisms contribute to signal-induced transcriptional responses, here we manipulate the signalling environment and activity of the histone demethylase LSD1 during differentiation of hESC-gut tube intermediates into pancreatic endocrine cells. We identify a transient requirement for LSD1 in endocrine cell differentiation spanning a short time-window early in pancreas development, a phenotype we reproduced in mice. Examination of enhancer and transcriptome landscapes revealed that LSD1 silences transiently active retinoic acid (RA)-induced enhancers and their target genes. Furthermore, prolonged RA exposure phenocopies LSD1 inhibition, suggesting that LSD1 regulates endocrine cell differentiation by limiting the duration of RA signalling. Our findings identify LSD1-mediated enhancer silencing as a cell-intrinsic epigenetic feedback mechanism by which the duration of the transcriptional response to a developmental signal is limited.
Despite significant progress in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a considerable part of patients remains resistant to the current therapy, apparently for the reasons of undefined mechanisms of its pathogenesis. Recently, the disturbances of circadian regulation of inflammatory processes in RA have been highlighted as important ones. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) and soluble toll-like receptors 2 (sTLR2) take part in the regulation of angiogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, immune responses but their circadian rhythms and predictive significance in RA patients are still unknown. Aim - to estimate the associations between efficacy of treatment and the circadian rhythms of NOS3 and sTLR2, and NOS3 polymorphism in females with rheumatoid arthritis, Ukraine. 97 RA patients (100% female) aged 46.3±8.89 years with disease duration 8.44±6.52 years were examined. All patients as a disease-modifying therapy received methotrexate (MTX) orally in a dose ≤15 mg/week, folic acid 5 mg/week, NSAIDs and corticosteroids (CS) ≤10 mg/day by prednisone. Doses of MTX, NSAIDs and CS were stable 4 weeks prior to the enrolment and during the whole period of study. The efficacy end points included DAS28, RAID and American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20/50/70). Serum levels of NOS3 and sTLR2 were determined at 08:00 and 20:00 using Cloud-Clone Corp kits (USA). NOS3 T-786С polymorphism was determined by Real-Time PCR. The SPSS22 software package was used for statistical processing of the results. The study was performed in accordance to the bioethical standards. After 12-week treatment among RA patients were revealed 52.6% ACR 20 responders and 47.4% non-responders. Opposite diurnal variation of NOS3 and sTLR2 serum levels were found in RA patients. There were significant differences in NOS3/sTLR2 ratio at 08:00 accordingly to NOS3 T786C genotype. The disturbances in daily variability of NOS3 or sTLR2 serum levels were more significant in non-responders compare to responders. Decrease of NOS3/sTLR2 ratio was a predictor of non-response to treatment in RA patients (β=0.366, р=0.000). In RA patients the disturbances of circadian rhythms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or toll-like receptors 2 expression are associated with an increase of resistance to disease-modifying therapy with methotrexate.
Several studies indicated that antipsychotic treatment response and side effect manifestation can be different due to inter-individual variability in genetic variations.
Here we perform a case-control study to explore a potential association between schizophrenia and variants within the antipsychotic drug molecular targets (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR6) and metabolizing enzymes (CYP2D6, COMT) genes in Armenian population including also analysis of their possible relationship with disease clinical symptoms.
A total of 18 SNPs was studied in patients with schizophrenia (n = 78) and healthy control subjects (n = 77) using MassARRAY genotyping.
We found that two studied genetic variants, namely DRD2 rs4436578*C and HTR2A rs6314*A are underrepresented in the group of patients compared to healthy subjects. After the correction for multiple testing, the rs4436578*C variant remained significant while the rs6314*A reported borderline significance. No significant differences in minor allele frequencies for other studied variants were identified. Also, a relationship between the genotypes and age of onset as well as disease duration has been detected.
The DRD2 rs4436578*C genetic variant might have protective role against schizophrenia, at least in Armenians.
Despite the introduction of numerous biologic agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, low-dose methotrexate therapy remains the gold standard in RA therapy. Methotrexate is generally the first-line drug for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, and it enhances the effect of most biologic agents in RA. Understanding the mechanism of action of methotrexate could be instructive in the appropriate use of the drug and in the design of new regimens for the treatment of RA. Although methotrexate is one of the first examples of intelligent drug design, multiple mechanisms potentially contribute to the anti-inflammatory actions of methotrexate, including the inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, transmethylation reactions, translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the nucleus, signalling via the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and nitric oxide production, as well as the promotion of adenosine release and expression of certain long non-coding RNAs.
Cytochrome P450 1b1 (Cyp1b1) deletion and dietary retinol deficiency during pregnancy (GVAD) affect perinatal liver functions regulated by Srebp. Cyp1b1 is not expressed in perinatal liver but appears in the E9.5 embryo, close to sites of retinoic acid (RA) signaling.
Parallel effects of Cyp1b1 and retinol on postnatal Srebp derive from effects in the developing liver or systemic signaling.
Cluster postnatal increases in hepatic genes in relation to effects of GVAD or Cyp1b1 deletion. Sort expression changes in relation to genes regulated by Srebp1 and Srebp2.Test these treatments on embryos at E9.5, examining changes at the site of liver initiation. Use in situ hybridization to resolve effects on mRNA distributions of Aldh1a2 and Cyp26a1 (RA homeostasis); Hoxb1 and Pax6 (RA targets). Assess mice lacking Lrat and Rbp4 (DKO mice) that severely limits retinol supply to embryos.
At birth, GVAD and Cyp1b1 deletion stimulate gene markers of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation but also suppress Hamp. These treatments then selectively prevent the postnatal onset of genes that synthesize cholesterol (Hmgcr, Sqle) and fatty acids (Fasn, Scd1), but also direct cholesterol transport (Ldlr, Pcsk9, Stard4) and retinoid synthesis (Aldh1a1, Rdh11). Extensive support by Cyp1b1 is implicated, but with distinct GVAD interventions for Srebp1 and Srebp2. At E9.5, Cyp1b1 is expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme (STM) with β-carotene oxygenase (Bco1) that generates retinaldehyde. STM provides progenitors for the HSC and supports liver expansion. GVAD and Cyp1b1-/- do not affect RA-dependent Hoxb1 and Pax6. In DKO embryos, RA-dependent Cyp26a1 is lost but Hoxb1 is sustained with Cyp1b1 at multiple sites.
Cyp1b1-/- suppresses genes supported by Srebp. GVAD effects distinguish Srebp1 and Srebp2 mediation. Srebp regulation overlaps appreciably in cholesterol and retinoid homeostasis. Bco1/Cyp1b1 partnership in the STM may contribute to this later liver regulation.
Proper organ development depends on coordinated communication between multiple cell types. Retinoic acid (RA) is an autocrine and paracrine signaling molecule essential for the development of most organs, including the lung. Despite extensive work detailing effects of RA deficiency in early lung morphogenesis, little is known about how RA regulates late gestational lung maturation. Here, we investigate the role of the RA catabolizing protein Cyp26b1 in the lung. Cyp26b1 is highly enriched in lung endothelial cells (ECs) throughout development. We find that loss of Cyp26b1 leads to reduction of alveolar type 1 cells, failure of alveolar inflation and early postnatal lethality in mouse. Furthermore, we observe expansion of distal epithelial progenitors, but no appreciable changes in proximal airways, ECs or stromal populations. Exogenous administration of RA during late gestation partially mimics these defects; however, transcriptional analyses comparing Cyp26b1-/- with RA-treated lungs reveal overlapping, but distinct, responses. These data suggest that defects observed in Cyp26b1-/- lungs are caused by both RA-dependent and RA-independent mechanisms. This work reports crucial cellular crosstalk during lung development involving Cyp26b1-expressing endothelium and identifies a novel RA modulator in lung development.
Dietary vitamin A is metabolized into bioactive retinoic acid (RA) in vivo and regulates the development of many embryonic tissues. RA signaling is active in the oral ectoderm-derived tissues of the neuroendocrine system, but its role there has not yet been fully explored. We show here that RA signaling is active during pituitary organogenesis and dependent on the pituitary transcription factor Prop1. Prop1-mutant mice show reduced expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene Aldh1a2, which metabolizes the vitamin A-intermediate retinaldehyde into RA. To elucidate the specific function of RA signaling during neuroendocrine development, we studied a conditional deletion of Aldh1a2 and a dominant-negative mouse model of inhibited RA signaling during pituitary organogenesis. These models partially phenocopy Prop1-mutant mice by exhibiting embryonic pituitary dysmorphology and reduced hormone expression, especially thyrotropin. These findings establish the role of RA in embryonic pituitary stem cell progression to differentiated hormone cells and raise the question of gene-by-environment interactions as contributors to pituitary development and disease.
Each vestibular sensory epithelium in the inner ear is divided morphologically and physiologically into two zones, called the striola and extrastriola in otolith organ maculae, and the central and peripheral zones in semicircular canal cristae. We found that formation of striolar/central zones during embryogenesis requires Cytochrome P450 26b1 (Cyp26b1)-mediated degradation of retinoic acid (RA). In Cyp26b1 conditional knockout mice, formation of striolar/central zones is compromised, such that they resemble extrastriolar/peripheral zones in multiple features. Mutants have deficient vestibular evoked potential (VsEP) responses to jerk stimuli, head tremor and deficits in balance beam tests that are consistent with abnormal vestibular input, but normal vestibulo-ocular reflexes and apparently normal motor performance during swimming. Thus, degradation of RA during embryogenesis is required for formation of highly specialized regions of the vestibular sensory epithelia with specific functions in detecting head motions.
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe, common birth defects that result from failure of normal neural tube closure during early embryogenesis. Accumulating strong evidence indicates that genetic factors contribute to NTDs etiology, among them, HOX genes play a key role in neural tube closure. Although abnormal HOX gene expression can lead to NTDs, the underlying pathological mechanisms have not fully been understood.
We detected that H3K27me3 and expression of the Hox genes in a retinoic acid (RA) induced mouse NTDs model on E8.5, E9.5 and E10.5 using RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays. Furthermore, we quantified 10 Hox genes using NanoString nCounter in brain tissue of fetuses with 39 NTDs patients including anencephaly, spina bifida, hydrocephaly and encephalocele.
Here, our results showed differential expression in 26 genes with a &gt; 20-fold change in the level of expression, including 10 upregulated Hox genes. RT-qPCR revealed that these 10 Hox genes were all upregulated in RA-induced mouse NTDs as well as RA-treated embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using ChIP-seq assays, we demonstrate that a decrease in H3K27me3 level upregulates the expression of Hox cluster A-D in RA-induced mouse NTDs model on E10.5. Interestingly, RA treatment led to attenuation of H3K27me3 due to cooperate between UTX and Suz12, affecting Hox gene regulation. Further analysis, in human anencephaly cases, upregulation of 10 HOX genes was observed, along with aberrant levels of H3K27me3. Notably, HOXB4, HOXC4 and HOXD1 expression was negatively correlated with H3K27me3 levels.
Our results indicate that abnormal HOX gene expression induced by aberrant H3K27me3 levels may be a risk factor for NTDs and highlight the need for further analysis of genome-wide epigenetic modification in NTDs.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a ligand for nuclear receptors that modulate gene transcription and cell differentiation. Whether RA controls ectopic calcification in humans is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that RA regulates osteogenic differentiation of human arterial smooth muscle cells and aortic valvular interstitial cells that participate in atherosclerosis and heart valve disease, respectively. Approach and Results: Human cardiovascular tissue contains immunoreactive RAR (RA receptor)-a retinoid-activated nuclear receptor directing multiple transcriptional programs. RA stimulation suppressed primary human cardiovascular cell calcification while treatment with the RAR inhibitor AGN 193109 or RARα siRNA increased calcification. RA attenuated calcification in a coordinated manner, increasing levels of the calcification inhibitor MGP (matrix Gla protein) while decreasing calcification-promoting TNAP (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase) activity. Given that nuclear receptor action varies as a function of distinct ligand structures, we compared calcification responses to cyclic retinoids and the acyclic retinoid peretinoin. Peretinoin suppressed human cardiovascular cell calcification without inducing either secretion of APOC3 (apolipoprotein-CIII), which promotes atherogenesis, or reducing CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1) expression, which occurred with cyclic retinoids all-trans RA, 9-cis RA, and 13-cis RA. Additionally, peretinoin did not suppress human femur osteoblast mineralization, whereas all-trans RA inhibited osteoblast mineralization.
These results establish retinoid regulation of human cardiovascular calcification, provide new insight into mechanisms involved in these responses, and suggest selective retinoid modulators, like acyclic retinoids may allow for treating cardiovascular calcification without the adverse effects associated with cyclic retinoids.
In our ongoing research to discover natural products with neuroprotective effects, hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-galactoside) was isolated from Acer tegmentosum, which has been used in Korean traditional medicine to treat liver-related disorders. Here, we demonstrated that hyperoside protects cultured dopaminergic neurons from death via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms, although other relevant mechanisms of hyperoside activity remain largely uncharacterized. For the first time, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of hyperoside on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in neurons, and the possible underlying mechanisms. Hyperoside significantly ameliorated the loss of neuronal cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, excessive ROS accumulation and mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction associated with 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, hyperoside treatment activated the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an upstream molecule of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Hyperoside also induced the expression of HO-1, an antioxidant response gene. Remarkably, we found that the neuroprotective effects of hyperoside were weakened by an Nrf2 small interfering RNA, which blocked the ability of hyperoside to inhibit neuronal death, indicating the vital role of HO-1. Overall, we show that hyperoside, via the induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activation, suppresses neuronal death caused by 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, Nrf2-dependent HO-1 signaling activation represents a potential preventive and therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease management.
Isotopic tracers are used to directly quantify the effect of mammary Δ9-desaturation on milk fatty acid (FA) composition, but very few studies have applied this method to measuring the endogenous synthesis of rumenic acid (RA; cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) in cows and goats, and no publications exist in ewes. In sheep, knowledge about the contribution of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) to milk FA secretion is derived mostly from indirect estimates based on inhibition of the enzyme by oral administration of cobalt, a cost-effective method that has not been validated to date. To fill both gaps, we conducted an isotopic tracer assay in sheep to quantify the proportion of endogenous RA in milk for the first time in this species. We then compared the results with estimates derived from a Co administration assay performed on the same animals. First, 5 lactating ewes received an intravenous injection of 200 mg of [1-13C]trans-11 18:1 (vaccenic acid, VA), the precursor for RA production by SCD activity. At -24, -15, 0, 9, 24, 33, 48, 57, 72, 81, and 96 h post-injection, we recorded milk yield and collected milk samples to examine fat concentration and FA profile. We conducted compound-specific isotope analysis of VA and RA by gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Afterward, in the Co administration assay, ewes received a daily dose of 7 mg of Co/kg of body weight for 5 d. We analyzed milk samples for composition before and on the last days of cobalt dosing. On average, 17% of the injected amount of [1-13C]VA was transferred to milk within 96 h post-injection, and up to 29% of the VA taken up by the mammary gland was desaturated to milk RA. Under our conditions, the mean proportion of this conjugated linoleic acid isomer deriving from Δ9-desaturation represented 82 to 90% of the amount secreted in milk. However, the proportion estimated in the Co assay with calculations based on individual FA concentrations was lower (on average, 46%). When we calculated the same estimates based on changes in Δ9-desaturation ratios after Co dosing, the higher values of endogenous RA (75%) did not differ from the results of the isotopic tracer assay. Nevertheless, correlation analysis between the results obtained through [1-13C]VA or Co administration revealed no significant relationship, which would prevent acceptance of the latter as a reliable alternative to isotopic labeling to examine mammary Δ9-desaturation in dairy ewes.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inﬂammatory synovitis resulting in progressive joint destruction. Persistent synovial inflammation is induced by activation of various inﬂammatory cells. G‑protein‑coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) is a G‑protein‑coupled receptor activated by various bile acids, which has been reported to act as a key adaptor in regulating various signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses and a diverse array of physiological processes, including bile acid synthesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, carcinogenesis, immunity and inflammation. In the present study, TGR5 expression was detected in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and its association with clinical disease activity, histological synovitis severity and radiological joint destruction was analyzed. Subsequently, the role and potential underlying mechanisms of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA and mice with collagen II‑induced arthritis (CIA) were investigated. PBMCs were obtained from 50 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls (HCs). The mRNA and protein expression levels of TGR5 were detected in PBMCs via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Additionally, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed by RT‑qPCR and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation of nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) and IκB kinase a was determined via western blot analysis. The anti‑arthritic and anti‑inflammatory effects of LCA on mice with CIA were then investigated. The arthritis score was assessed, and the protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma of mice were detected via ELISA. TGR5 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in the PBMCs of patients with RA compared with in those of the HCs (0.53±0.58 for patients vs. 1.49±0.83 for HCs; P&lt;0.001); similar findings were observed at the protein level. The mRNA expression levels of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA with a high 28‑Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) were significantly decreased compared with in patients with a low DAS28 (0.81±0.65 for low score vs. 0.35±0.46 for high score; P=0.002). Furthermore, TGR5 expression was significantly correlated with the levels of C‑reactive protein (r=‑0.429; P=0.002) and the DAS28 (r=‑0.383; P=0.006). RT‑qPCR and ELISA analyses indicated that lithocholic acid (LCA, 10 mg/kg/day) attenuated lipopolysaccharide‑induced proinflammatory cytokine production via inhibition of NF‑κB activity in the PBMCs of patients with RA. In addition, the arthritis score was significantly decreased in LCA‑treated CIA mice compared with in non‑treated CIA mice. The increased production of tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6 and IL‑8 was significantly reduced in the plasma of LCA‑treated CIA mice compared with the control. In conclusion, TGR5 may contribute to the inflammation of PBMCs in patients with RA and mice with CIA.
The genus Waminoa currently contains two described species, which each contains two types of endosymbiotic algae. Waminoa individuals are basically brown in body color, derived from these algal symbionts, and their body shape has been described as "discoid to obcordate". They have been found as associates of various anthozoans (Cnidaria) in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and the Red Sea. In order to reveal the diversity of the genus Waminoa and their hosts, we conducted phylogenetic and morphological analyses on acoelomate flatworms specimens collected from Japan, Palau and Indonesia. At least 18 Waminoa morphotypes were found on at least 20 anthozoan host species, and two specimens were found on species of two sea stars. Overall, there were two main body shapes of specimens; obcordate, as seen in W. litus and W. brickneri, and the other molar-like with an elongated body. These two body shapes each represented a separate clade in 18S rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) phylogenetic trees, with W. brickneri included in the obcordate subclade. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) analyses on COI sequences of our specimens revealed the presence of at least five operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These five OTUs consisted of one large group of all obcordate animals, three OTUs consisting of one specimen each within the molar-like clade, and one large group of the remaining molar-like specimens. Both clades contain numerous morphotypes and were associated with a variety of hosts. Finally, based on genetic distances, the molar-like specimens are considered as an unnamed genus group separate from Waminoa, which needs to be clarified in future studies.
Premature overexposure to thyroid hormone causes profound effects on testis growth, spermatogenesis, and male fertility. We used genetic mouse models of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) deficiency to determine the genetic programs affected by premature thyroid hormone action and to define the role of DIO3 in regulating thyroid hormone economy in testicular cells. Gene expression profiling in the neonatal testis of DIO3-deficient mice identified 5699 differentially expressed genes. Upregulated and downregulated genes were, respectively, involved according to DAVID analysis with cell differentiation and proliferation. They included anti-Müllerian hormone and genes involved in the formation of the blood-testis barrier, which are specific to Sertoli cells (SCs). They also included steroidogenic genes, which are specific to Leydig cells. Comparison with published data sets of genes enriched in SCs and spermatogonia, and responsive to retinoic acid (RA), identified a subset of genes that were regulated similarly by RA and thyroid hormone. This subset of genes showed an expression bias, as they were downregulated when enriched in spermatogonia and upregulated when enriched in SCs. Furthermore, using a genetic approach, we found that DIO3 is not expressed in SCs, but spermatogonia-specific inactivation of DIO3 led to impaired testis growth, reduced SC number, decreased cell proliferation and, especially during neonatal development, altered gene expression specific to somatic cells. These findings indicate that spermatogonial DIO3 protects testicular cells from untimely thyroid hormone signaling and demonstrate a mechanism of cross-talk between somatic and germ cells in the neonatal testis that involves the regulation of thyroid hormone availability and action.
The dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors leflunomide and teriflunomide are immunomodulatory agents approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis, respectively, and are actively being investigated as therapeutic agents for other immune-related diseases; however, both structurally related compounds have a number of potentially serious adverse effects. Vidofludimus, a new selective second-generation DHODH inhibitor, is chemically distinct from leflunomide/teriflunomide and appears to exhibit a distinct safety profile.
The aim of the COMPONENT study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of vidofludimus in the treatment of patients with active RA on a background therapy of methotrexate. This report focuses solely on the safety results of the COMPONENT trial.
Patients received once-daily oral vidofludimus (N = 122) or placebo (N = 119) along with their standard of care methotrexate treatment for 13 weeks. Efficacy endpoints were assessed. Safety parameters were monitored throughout treatment and at follow-up. Plasma concentrations of vidofludimus were measured.
The primary efficacy endpoint, American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) responder rate at 13 weeks, demonstrated numerical superiority in the treatment group compared with placebo; however, it did not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, the COMPONENT study yielded important safety and pharmacokinetic data that could provide important information regarding the use of vidofludimus in other clinical trials, not only for RA but also for other autoimmune diseases. A safety profile for vidofludimus similar to placebo was obtained in this RA patient population. This includes similar rates of the adverse events of diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, and elevated liver enzymes, all of which are known drug-related adverse events reported for leflunomide and teriflunomide. A potential pharmacokinetic interaction between vidofludimus and methotrexate was observed.
Vidofludimus demonstrated a positive safety profile, making it a promising candidate for the treatment of a variety of immune-related diseases.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01010581.
In the current investigation, the effects of the P2Y12 blocker ticagrelor, the sodium/glucose transporter-2-inhibitor empagliflozin, and the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen were examined against rheumatoid arthritis (RA)/diabetes mellitus (DM)-co-morbidity-induced defects in vascular reactivity.
After model setting, rats were allocated into a normal control, an RA/DM-co-morbidity, and three treatment groups receiving ticagrelor, empagliflozin and tamoxifen. Aorta tissue was isolated for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot estimation of the pro-inflammatory molecules angiotensin-II (Ang-II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the adhesion molecules P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the energy preserving molecule adenosine-5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the anti-inflammatory molecule vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Estimations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 were performed immunohistochemically, together with histopathological examination using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining. An in vitro study on rat aortic strips was conducted to assess aorta vasorelaxation.
Ticagrelor, empagliflozin and tamoxifen significantly increased aorta tissue AMPK and eNOS and decreased Ang-II, ET-1, P-selectin, VCAM-1 and VIP levels compared with RA/DM-co-morbidity, coupled with improved acetylcholine vasorelaxation in vitro.
Ticagrelor, empagliflozin and tamoxifen may correct vascular reactivity defects, where modulation of vascular AMPK, eNOS, Ang-II, ET-1, P-selectin, VCAM-1 and MMP-2 underline their protective effects.
As a means to maintain their sessile lifestyle amid challenging environments, plants produce an enormous diversity of compounds as chemical defenses against biotic and abiotic insults. The underpinning metabolic pathways that support the biosynthesis of these specialized chemicals in divergent plant species provide a rich arena for understanding the molecular evolution of complex metabolic traits. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic natural product first discovered in plants of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is recognized for its wide range of medicinal properties and potential applications in human dietary and medical interventions. Interestingly, the RA chemotype is present sporadically in multiple taxa of flowering plants as well as some hornworts and ferns, prompting the question whether its biosynthesis arose independently across different lineages. Here we report the elucidation of the RA biosynthetic pathway in Phacelia campanularia (desert bells). This species represents the borage family (Boraginaceae), an RA-producing family closely related to the Lamiaceae within the Lamiids clade. Using a multi-omics approach in combination with functional characterization of candidate genes both in vitro and in vivo, we found that RA biosynthesis in P. campanularia involves specific activities of a BAHD acyltransferase and two cytochrome P450 hydroxylases. Further phylogenetic and comparative structure-function analyses of the P. campanularia RA biosynthetic enzymes clearly indicate that RA biosynthesis has evolved independently at least twice in the Lamiids, an exemplary case of chemotypic convergence through disparate evolutionary trajectories.
The green microalgae Parachlorella kessleri RA-002 isolated in Armenia can produce biohydrogen (H2) during oxygenic photosynthesis. Addition of protonophores, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNF) enhances H2 yield in P. kessleri. The maximal H2 yield of ~2.20 and 2.08 mmol L-1 was obtained in the presence of 15 μM CCCP and 50 μM DNF, respectively. During dark conditions H2 production by P. kessleri was not observed even in the presence of protonophores, indicating that H2 formation in these algae was mediated by light conditions. The enhancing effect of protonophores can be coupled with dissipation of proton motive force across thylakoid membrane in P. kessleri, facilitating the availability of protons and electrons to [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase, which led to formation of H2. At the same time H2 production was not observed in the presence of diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), a specific inhibitor of PS II. Moreover, diuron inhibits H2 yield in P. kessleri in the presence of protonophores. The inhibitory effect of diuron coupled with suppression of electron transfer from PS II. The results showed that in these algae operates PS II-dependent pathway of H2 generation. This study is important for understanding of the mechanisms of H2 production by green microalgae P. kessleri and developing of its biotechnology.
Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) can trigger NADPH oxidase (NOX) and lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a phenolic composite in olive oil that has antioxidant and anti‑inflammatory effects and enhances autophagy. Early research has revealed that HT can activate the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) pathway to induce autophagy and alleviate the cartilage inflammatory response caused by H2O2. However, whether HT can attenuate AOPP‑induced NOX and inflammatory responses remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate how HT can alleviate the damage caused by AOPPs. In cell experiments, chondrocytes were pre‑stimulated with HT and then exposed to AOPPs. First, it was found that HT promoted autophagy through the SIRT1 pathway, increased the expression of autophagy‑related proteins including microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3, autophagy related (ATG)5 and ATG7, and decreased the expression of P62. Furthermore, HT reduced the expression of NOX, which was affected by AOPPs in chondrocytes through the SIRT1 pathway. Finally, the expression of inflammatory cytokines caused by AOPPs was downregulated following HT treatment. In conclusion, it was found that HT reduced the expression of NOX and inhibited the inflammatory response caused by AOPPs in chondrocytes through the SIRT1 pathway.
Variable levels of DNA methylation have been reported at tissue-specific differential methylation regions (DMRs) overlapping enhancers, including super-enhancers (SEs) associated with key cell identity genes, but the mechanisms responsible for this intriguing behavior are not well understood. We used allele-specific reporters at the endogenous Sox2 and Mir290 SEs in embryonic stem cells and found that the allelic DNA methylation state is dynamically switching, resulting in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Dynamic DNA methylation is driven by the balance between DNA methyltransferases and transcription factor binding on one side and co-regulated with the Mediator complex recruitment and H3K27ac level changes at regulatory elements on the other side. DNA methylation at the Sox2 and the Mir290 SEs is independently regulated and has distinct consequences on the cellular differentiation state. Dynamic allele-specific DNA methylation at the two SEs was also seen at different stages in preimplantation embryos, revealing that methylation heterogeneity occurs in vivo.
The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) family 26 enzymes contribute to retinoic acid (RA) metabolism and homeostasis in humans, mammals and other chordates. The three CYP26 family enzymes, CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1 have all been shown to metabolize all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) it's 9-cisRA and 13-cisRA isomers and primary metabolites 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA with high efficiency. While no crystal structures of CYP26 enzymes are available, the binding of various ligands has been extensively explored via homology modeling. All three CYP26 enzymes are inducible by treatment with atRA in various prenatal and postnatal tissues and cell types. However, current literature shows that in addition to regulation by atRA, CYP26 enzyme expression is also regulated by other endogenous processes and inflammatory cytokines. In humans and in animal models the expression patterns of CYP26 enzymes have been shown to be tissue and cell type specific, and the expression of the CYP26 enzymes is believed to regulate the formation of critical atRA concentration gradients in various tissue types. Yet, very little data exists on direct disease associations of altered CYP26 expression or activity. Nevertheless, data is emerging describing a variety of human genetic variations in the CYP26 enzymes that are associated with different pathologies. Interestingly, some of these genetic variants result in increased activity of the CYP26 enzymes potentially leading to complex gene-environment interactions due to variability in dietary intake of retinoids. This review highlights the current knowledge of structure-function of CYP26 enzymes and focuses on their role in human retinoid metabolism in different tissues.
Subsequent to somatic gonadal sexual differentiation, germ cells enter meiosis or mitotic arrest in the ovary or testis, respectively. Among mice, these processes occur almost synchronically in fetal gonads and depend, among other factors, on the levels of retinoic acid (RA). In contrast to those in mice, rabbit germ cells enter meiosis or mitotic arrest after birth and coexist with proliferating germ cells. Here, we studied the somatic cell context in which germ cells enter meiosis or mitotic arrest in the rabbit. Using confocal immunofluorescence and real-time PCR, we studied the expression profiles of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2 and, comprising 2 genes required for RA synthesis, 2 meiosis markers STRA8 and SYCP3 as well as 2 genes involved in meiosis inhibition, CYP26B1 and NANOS2. We found that although both meiosis and mitotic arrest initiate after birth, these 2 processes are regulated in a way similar to the human fetal gonad. Current results reinforce the value of the neonatal rabbit gonad as an alternative experimental model for analyzing the direct effect of environmental factors during critical stages of germ cell establishment.
Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous toxic heavy metal derived mainly from industrial processes. In industrialized societies, individuals are exposed to a plethora of sources of Cd pollution. Cd can trigger serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by the over-activating immune system. As an effector mechanism in innate immunity, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) not only play an important role in defending against infection but also lead to tissue damage. However, the role of NETs in Cd-induced lung damage process has not been previously studied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of Cd-induced NETs on lung injury in vivo and further to clarify the molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced NETs formation. In vivo, Cd treatment destroyed the structural integrity of lung tissue and significantly increased the levels of NETs in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The known NETs inhibitor DNase I ameliorated pathologic changes and significantly decreased levels of NETs in BALF, which suggesting the curial role of NETs in Cd-induced lung injury. Further investigation showed that Cd could significantly trigger NETs formation, which is composed of DNA backbone decorated with histones (H3) and neutrophils elastase (NE). The inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways significantly reduced the formation of NETs, and western blotting analysis also showed that Cd significantly increased the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Above results confirmed that NADPH oxidase, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways were related to Cd-induced NETs formation. In conclusion, NETs was involved in Cd-induced lung injury, and the mechanisms of Cd-induced NETs formation was via activating NADPH oxidase, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways, which might provide a new perspective in Cd-induced lung injury.
Introduction. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine with upstream regulatory roles in innate and adaptive immunity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several classes of MIF inhibitors such as small molecule inhibitors and peptide inhibitors are in clinical development. Areas covered. The role of MIF in the pathogenesis of RA and SLE is examined; the authors review the structure, physiology and signaling characteristics of MIF and the related cytokine D-DT/MIF-2. The preclinical and clinical trial data for MIF inhibitors are also reviewed; information was retrieved from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov using the keywords MIF, D-DT/MIF-2, CD74, CD44, CXCR2, CXCR4, Jab-1, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, MIF inhibitor, small molecule, anti-MIF, anti-CD74, and peptide inhibitor. Expert opinion. Studies in mice and in humans demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MIF inhibition for RA and SLE. MIF- directed approaches could be particularly efficacious in patients with high expression MIF genetic polymorphisms. In patients with RA and SLE and high expression MIF alleles, targeted MIF inhibition could be a precision medicine approach to treatment. Anti-MIF pharmacotherapies could also be steroid-sparing in patients with chronic glucocorticoid dependence or refractory autoimmune disease.
To evaluate the effects of combination of Radix Astragali (RA) and Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (RS) on kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and renal intrinsic cells.
SHRs were intragastrically administrated with RA (5.09 g/kg) and RS (2.55 g/kg) either alone or with combination for 4 weeks; valsartan (13.35 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Blood pressure and renal ultrasonography were monitored periodically. The biomarkers [microalbumin (mALB), cystatin ^C, angiotensin II (Ang II), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and β2-microglobulin (β2-Mg), etc.] in serum and urine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expressions [phosphorylated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase-α1 (p-AMPKα1), sestrin-β, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CaMKK-β), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (AKT1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)] in renal cortex were determined by Western blot. In vitro, the hypertensive cellular model was established by applying 2×10-6 mol/L Ang ^II. The primary human podocytes, human glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs), and human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2s) were pre-incubated with sulfotanshinone sodium (Tan, 10 μg/mL) and/or calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (Cal, 5 μg/mL). The cellular viability and apoptosis were assayed by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Annexin V/PI staining, respectively. The level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in culture supernatant was determined by ELISA.
RA+RS signifificantly decreased the diastolic blood pressure, renal vascular resistance index, and parenchymal thickness, increased 24 h urinary volume as well as lowered the levels of urine mALB and serum cystatin ^C, IL-1β and β2-Mg of SHRs (P &lt;0.05 vs. SHRs). The decreased protein levels of p-AMPKα1, sestrinβ and CaMKK-β and the increased protein levels of PI3K, AKT1 and VEGFR2 in renal cortex of SHRs were normalized after RA+RS treatment (P &lt;0.05). In vitro, Tan and Cal attenuated the Ang II-induced abnormal proliferation and increased the apoptosis of HRGECs and HK-2s and improved the level of eNOS in culture supernatant. Whereas, neither of them showed powerful effect on podocyte.
The combination of RA and RS had potential effects on alleviating the renal damages of SHRs and the renoprotection was independent of blood pressure level.
The effect of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) on embryogenesis is tissue specific and highly concentration dependent. Using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based method to quantify trace amounts of RA in embryonic tissue requires expensive specialist facilities. Here, we describe the use of a RA response element (RARE)-lacZ reporter cell-based method, which is simple and cost effective, to measure RA levels in small pieces of tissue from the embryo. We further apply this method to quantitatively assay activities of RA-synthesizing and RA-catabolizing enzymes, the key regulators of RA bioavailability in tissues and developing organs of the embryo.
Tangeretin (TAN), a major phytochemical in tangerine peels and an important Chinese herb, has multiple biological properties, especially antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to assess the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of TAN in bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis rats.
TAN (50 mg/kg) was given orally once daily for 14 days. The effects of treatment were evaluated by biochemical assay (articular elastase, myeloperoxidase, end products of lipid peroxidation [MDA], antioxidant enzyme, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione), nitric oxide, and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], -IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interferon-γ [IFN-γ], and prostaglandin E2 [PGE2]). The protective effects of TAN against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were evident from the decrease in arthritis scoring. Furthermore, the Nrf-2 signaling pathway was assessed to illustrate the molecular mechanism.
TAN had therapeutic effects on RA by decreasing the oxidative stress damage and regulating inflammatory cytokine expression, including suppression of the accumulation of MDA products, decreasing the IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and PGE2 levels, enhancing the IL-10 and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, which was through upregulating Nrf-2 signaling pathway.
TAN might have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA.
Introduction: The cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib is an approved compound for rheumatoid (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), combining both anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties with a good gastrointestinal tolerability. Areas covered: This article covers the pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy as well as the latest safety data available for celecoxib with emphasis on the treatment of RA and OA. It is based primarily on a current literature search on PubMed and Web of Science, but also on the professional rheumatological expertise of the authors. Expert opinion: Celecoxib has been shown to be superior to placebo and equivalent to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs). Many studies have been published making celecoxib a good and safe treatment option in particular in moderate arthritis and patients without established cardiovascular (CV) disease. Moreover, older patients might gain significant benefits compared to tNSAIDs due to reduced gastrointestinal events even when having a history of ulcer bleedings. Nonetheless, there is still much to learn, especially regarding the prescription of celecoxib in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities. While low doses seem to be safe according to present data, the knowledge on the more effective, higher doses &gt;400 mg/day is still limited.
Exploration of renewable energy sources is an imperative task in order to replace fossil fuels and to diminish atmospheric pollution. Hydrogen is considered one of the most promising fuels for the future and implores further investigation to find eco-friendly ways toward viable production. Expansive processes like electrolysis and fossil fuels are currently being used to produce hydrogen. Biological hydrogen production (BHP) displays recyclable and economical traits, and is thus imperative for hydrogen economy. Three basic modes of BHP were investigated, including bio photolysis, photo fermentation and dark fermentation. Photosynthetic microorganisms could readily serve as powerhouses to successively produce this type of energy. Cyanobacteria, blue green algae (bio photolysis) and some purple non-sulfur bacteria (Photo fermentation) utilize solar energy and produce hydrogen during their metabolic processes. Ionic species, including hydrogen (H+) and electrons (e-) are combined into hydrogen gas (H2), with the use of special enzymes called hydrogenases in the case of bio photolysis, and nitrogenases catalyze the formation of hydrogen in the case of photo fermentation. Nevertheless, oxygen sensitivity of these enzymes is a drawback for bio photolysis and photo fermentation, whereas, the amount of hydrogen per unit substrate produced appears insufficient for dark fermentation. This review focuses on innovative advances in the bioprocess research, genetic engineering and bioprocess technologies such as microbial fuel cell technology, in developing bio hydrogen production.
The effects of chalcone and butein on the induction of the superoxide anion (O2- )-generating system were studied in U937 cells by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The chalcone skeleton, a common structural motif in them, significantly enhanced the transcription of gp91-phox in an epigenetic manner. In contrast, chalcone and butein showed opposite effects on the induction of the O2- -generating activity by RA and the expression of gp91-phox protein. Chalcone inhibited, whereas butein promoted, the induction of O2- -generating activity by RA and the expression of gp91-phox protein. These data raise the possibility that modification of the chalcone skeleton could produce more effective differentiation-promoting agents.
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are lesions that involve loss of epithelium and dermis, sometimes involving deep structures, compartments, and bones. The aim of this work is to investigate the innate regenerative properties of dermal tissue around ulcers by the identification and analysis of resident dermal stem cells (DSCs). Dermal samples were taken at the edge of DFUs, and genes related to the wound healing process were analyzed by the real-time PCR array. The DSCs were isolated and analyzed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR array to define their stemness properties. The gene expression profile of dermal tissue showed a dysregulation in growth factors, metalloproteinases, collagens, and integrins involved in the wound healing process. In the basal condition, diabetic DSCs adhered on the culture plate with spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology. They were positive to the mesenchymal stem cells markers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, but negative for the hematopoietic markers CD14, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR. In diabetic DSCs, the transcription of genes related to self-renewal and cell division were equivalent to that in normal DSCs. However, the expression of CCNA2, CCND2, CDK1, ALDH1A1, and ABCG2 was downregulated compared with that of normal DSCs. These genes are also related to cell cycle progression and stem cell maintenance. Further investigation will improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these genes together govern cell proliferation, revealing new strategies useful for future treatment of DFUs.
Cleft palate is a common birth defect, occurring in approximately 1 in 1000 live births worldwide. Known etiological mechanisms of cleft palate include defects within developing palate shelf tissues, defects in mandibular growth and defects in spontaneous fetal mouth movement. Until now, experimental studies directly documenting fetal mouth immobility as an underlying cause of cleft palate have been limited to models lacking neurotransmission. This study extends the range of anomalies directly demonstrated to have fetal mouth movement defects correlated with cleft palate. Here, we show that mouse embryos deficient in retinoic acid (RA) have mispatterned pharyngeal nerves and skeletal elements that block spontaneous fetal mouth movement in utero Using X-ray microtomography, in utero ultrasound video, ex vivo culture and tissue staining, we demonstrate that proper retinoid signaling and pharyngeal patterning are crucial for the fetal mouth movement needed for palate formation. Embryos with deficient retinoid signaling were generated by stage-specific inactivation of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (Rdh10), a gene crucial for the production of RA during embryogenesis. The finding that cleft palate in retinoid deficiency results from a lack of fetal mouth movement might help elucidate cleft palate etiology and improve early diagnosis in human disorders involving defects of pharyngeal development.
Epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for immune cell differentiation by regulating gene transcription. However, the role and mechanism of histone methylation in the development and differentiation of iNKT cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mice have yet to be deciphered. The DBA/1 mouse RA model was established by using a modified GPI mixed peptide. We demonstrated that total peripheral blood, thymus, and spleen iNKT cells in RA mice decreased significantly, while iNKT1 in the thymus and spleen was increased significantly. PLZF protein and PLZF mRNA levels were significantly decreased in thymus DP T cells, while T-bet protein and mRNA were significantly increased in thymus iNKT cells. We found a marked accumulation in H3K27me3 around the promoter regions of the signature gene Zbtb16 in RA mice thymus DP T cells, and an accumulation of H3K4me3 around the promoters of the Tbx21 gene in iNKT cells. The expression levels of UTX in the thymus of RA mice were significantly reduced. The changes in the above indicators were particularly significant in the progressive phase of inflammation (11 days after modeling) and the peak phase of inflammation (14 days after modeling) in RA mice. Developmental and differentiation defects of iNKT cells in RA mice were associated with abnormal methylation levels (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) in the promoters of key genes Zbtb16 (encoding PLZF) and Tbx21 (encoding T-bet). Decreased UTX of thymus histone demethylase levels resulted in the accumulation of H3K27me3 modification.
This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) induction by 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in collagen-induced arthritis in rats.
Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 10/group) and were treated intraperitoneally twice a week for 4 weeks, namely normal control (saline), arthritis control (AR; saline), AR + 17-AAG, AR + methotrexate (MTX), and AR + 17-AAG + MTX. At the end of the treatments, arthritic score was determined and then the animals were sacrificed. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum levels of HSP70, interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), rheumatic factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were determined.
In the AR group, all parameters increased significantly, except for GPx, which showed a pronounced decrease. The 17-AAG and/or MTX treatments significantly reduced arthritic score, ESR, IL-17, TNF-α, RF, CRP, MDA, and MMP-9 with significant increase in GPx compared to the AR group. The HSP70 level was significantly higher in the AR + 17-AAG and the AR + 17-AAG + MTX groups but significantly lower in the AR + MTX group as compared to the AR group. Also, it was significantly lower in the AR + MTX group as compared to the AR + 17-AAG group.
We concluded that HSP70 induction by 17-AAG attenuated the inflammatory process in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model induced by collagen, which suggested that HSP70 inducers can be promising agents in the treatment of RA.
Rosmarinic acid (RA) has a wide range of biological effects, including the antioxidation and antiaging. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear but highly attractive. Herein, RA promoted lifespan and motoricity in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced fat store without threatening fertility in Caenorhabditis elegans. In term of antioxidant efficacy, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidas activity, reduced glutathione content, and reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio were enhanced. And malondialdehyde content was diminished significantly. Moreover, RA increased survival under acute oxidative and thermal stress, and suppressed intestinal lipofuscin accumulation. So the improvement of lifespan mediated by RA could be related with its strong antioxidant properties. Furthermore, RA was absorbed by worms. Further research in pursuit of the mechanism showed that longevity induced by RA was involved with the genes sod-3, sod-5, ctl-1, daf-16, ins-18, skn-1, and sek-1, but was independent of subcellular localization of DAF-16. These findings indicated that RA had a potential for promoting healthy lifespan.
Studies have indicated that epilepsy, an important neurological disease, can generate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, among other damages to the brain. In this context, the use of antioxidant compounds could provide neuroprotection and help to reduce the damage caused by epileptic seizures and thereby the use of anticonvulsant drugs. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylactic acid that prevents cell damage caused by free radicals, acting as an antioxidant. It also presents anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and antiapoptotic properties. In this work, we used two models of acute seizure, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and picrotoxin (PTX)-induced seizures in mice, to investigate the anticonvulsant, antioxidant, and neuroprotective profile of RA. Diazepam and valproic acid, antiepileptic drugs already used in the treatment of epilepsy, were used as positive controls. Although RA could not prevent seizures in the models used in this study, neither enhance the latency time to first seizure at the tested doses, it exhibited an antioxidant and neuroprotective effect. RA (8 and 16 mg/kg) decreased reactive oxygen species production, superoxide dismutase activity, and DNA damage, measured in hippocampus, after seizures induced by PTX and 4-AP. Catalase activity was decreased by RA only after seizures induced by 4-AP. The activity of the mitochondrial complex II was increased by RA in hippocampus samples after both seizure models. The results obtained in this study suggest that RA is able to reduce cell damage generated by the 4-AP and PTX seizures and therefore could represent a potential candidate in reducing pathophysiological processes involved in epilepsy.
Acquired chemoresistance is a critical issue for advanced bladder cancer patients during long-term treatment. Recent studies reveal that a fraction of tumor cells with enhanced tumor-initiating potential, or cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), may particularly contribute to acquired chemoresistance and recurrence. Thus, CSC characterization will be the first step towards understanding the mechanisms underlying advanced disease. Here we generated long-term patient-derived cancer cells (PDCs) from bladder cancer patient specimens in spheroid culture, which is favorable for CSC enrichment. Pathological features of bladder cancer PDCs and PDC-dependent patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were basically similar to those of their corresponding patients' specimens. Notably, CSC marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), a critical enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acid (RA), was abundantly expressed in PDCs. ALDH1A1 inhibitors and shRNAs repressed both PDC proliferation and spheroid formation, whereas all-trans RA could rescue ALDH1A1 shRNA-suppressed spheroid formation. ALDH inhibitor also reduced the in vivo growth of PDC-derived xenografts. ALDH1A1 knockdown study showed that tubulin beta III (TUBB3) was one of the downregulated genes in PDCs. We identified functional RA response elements in TUBB3 promoter, whose transcriptional activities were substantially activated by RA. Clinical survival database reveals that TUBB3 expression may associate with poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients. Moreover, TUBB3 knockdown was sufficient to suppress PDC proliferation and spheroid formation. Taken together, our results indicate that ALDH1A1 and its putative downstream target TUBB3 are overexpressed in bladder cancer, and those molecules could be applied to alternative diagnostic and therapeutic options for advanced disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease primarily characterized by chronic inflammation, the formation of an invasive pannus, and destruction of the joints. In the present study, we employed real-time PCR and western blot analysis to investigate the role of dulaglutide in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The results of our study show that dulaglutide exerted a powerful protective effect by rescuing mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibiting the production of NOX-4, and abrogating TNF-α-induced downregulation of the antioxidant GSH. Our findings demonstrate that dulaglutide significantly ameliorated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and HMGB-1. Matrix metalloproteinases mediate cartilage destruction, thereby aiding in pannus formation. Our findings indicate that dulaglutide treatment significantly downregulated the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13, two crucial degradative enzymes. Importantly, the results of our study demonstrate that the beneficial effects of dulaglutide are mediated through the JNK/NF-κB signaling pathway, which has been suggested as a potential treatment target against RA. Taken together, the results of this study show that dulaglutide may exert significant protective effects against the progression of RA induced by TNF-α.
We aimed to investigate the regulation of circular RNAs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated chondrocytes isolated from SD rat. In this study, we analyzed how circFADS2 was regulated in LPS-treated chondrocytes and isolates from Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and found that circFADS2 and mTOR were highly expressed whereas miR-498 expression was significantly reduced. We then silenced circFADS2 in LPS-treated chondrocytes; this resulted in a declined expression of type II collagen, but an increase in the expression of MMP-13, COX-2, and IL-6. Overall, silencing circFADS2 caused a significant reduction in the proliferative rate of LPS-treated chondrocytes, increased apoptotic levels, miR-498 upregulation, and mTOR downregulation. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that circFADS2 directly targeted miR-498. In contrast, miR-498 down-regulation affected circFADS2 silencing, promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and apoptosis. The 3' UTR of the mTOR gene is targeted by miR-498, and consequently, in cells transfected with miR-498, there was a significant reduction of mTOR expression at the protein and mRNA levels. Silencing mTOR had a similar effect to circFADS2 silencing on type II collagen, MMP-13, COX-2, and IL-6 expression, as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, circFADS2 may affect LPS-induced chondrocytes properties by regulating the ECM catabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis in chondrocytes.
A high-fat diet (HFD) and overweight status can induce hippocampal dysfunction, leading to depression and anxiety. Exercise has beneficial effects on emotional behaviors. We previously reported that exercise training rescues HFD-induced excess hippocampal neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, which is a key regulator of anxiety. Here, we investigated anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal nNOS expression in response to HFD combined with exercise. Mice were assigned to standard diet, HFD, or HFD with exercise groups for 12 weeks. We found that exercise during the final 6 weeks of the HFD regime improved 12 weeks of HFD-induced defecation, accompanied by rescue of excess nNOS expression. However, anxiety indicators in the elevated plus maze were unchanged. These effects were not apparent after only 1 week of exercise. In conclusion, 6 weeks of exercise training reduced HFD-related anxiety according to one of our measures (defecation), and reversed changes in the hippocampal nNOS/NO pathway.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that maternal inflammation or neonatal hyperoxia adversely affects kidney maturation. This study explored whether prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure can augment neonatal hyperoxia-induced kidney injury.
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injections of LPS (0.5 mg/kg) in normal saline (NS) or NS on 20 and 21 days of gestation. The pups were reared in room air (RA) or 2 weeks of 85% O2, creating the four study groups, NS + RA, NS + O2, LPS + RA, and LPS + O2. Kidneys were taken for oxidase stress and histological analyses.
The rats exposed to maternal LPS or neonatal hyperoxia exhibited significantly higher kidney injury score, lower glomerular number, higher toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expressions, and higher MPO activity compared with the rats exposed to maternal NS and neonatal RA. The rats exposed to both maternal LPS and neonatal hyperoxia exhibited significantly lower glomerular number, higher kidney injury score, TLR4, MPO, and 8-OHdG expressions compared with the rats exposed to maternal LPS or neonatal hyperoxia.
Maternal inflammation exacerbates neonatal hyperoxia-induced kidney injury and the underlying mechanism may be related to activation of TLR4 and increased oxidative stress.
This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between concomitant biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and prednisolone administration and blood tacrolimus exposure or serum CYP3A4/5-related markers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients without severe disease activity.
Forty-six RA patients treated with oral tacrolimus once daily for maintenance of clinical remission to moderate disease activity were enrolled. The blood concentrations of tacrolimus and its major metabolite were determined at 12 h after the evening dosing. Blood samples for determination of serum markers including 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and CYP3A5 genotype were collected.
Most enrolled patients had RA with clinical remission to mild disease activity. Concomitant tocilizumab or low-dose prednisolone administration did not alter the blood tacrolimus exposure. Serum 4β-OHC level was lower in tocilizumab co-treated patients than in the biologic DMARD non-treated patients. The blood tacrolimus concentration was inversely correlated with the serum level of 25-OHD, but not 4β-OHC and IL-6. The serum level of 4β-OHC was positively associated with that of 25-OHD. No correlations were observed between the serum levels of CYP3A4/5 activity markers and IL-6. The patients with the homozygous CYP3A5*3 had the higher blood tacrolimus concentration, while CYP3A5*3 allele was not associated with the serum levels of 4β-OHC and 25-OHD.
Concomitant use of tocilizumab or low-dose prednisolone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, while tocilizumab lowered serum 4β-OHC. Blood tacrolimus exposure was negatively associated with serum 25-OHD in RA patients with clinical remission to moderate disease activity.
Flavonoids play multiple roles in plant coloration and stress resistance and are closely associated with human health. Flavonoids and non-flavonoids (such as phenolic acids) are produced via the phenylpropanoid-derived pathway. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) catalyzes the synthesis of anthocyanins from leucoanthocyanidin in the flavonoids branched pathway. In this study, SmANS from Salvia miltiorrhiza was cloned and mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plastids, Golgi, plasma membrane, and nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells, and was most highly expressed in purple petals in S. miltiorrhiza, whereas it showed almost no expression in white petals, green calyxes, and pistils in S. miltiorrhiza Bge f. alba. Overexpressed SmANS enhanced anthocyanin accumulation but reduced salvianolic acid B (SAB) and rosmarinic acid (RA) biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza and S. miltiorrhiza Bge f. alba plantlets, meanwhile, it restored the purple-red phenotype in S. miltiorrhiza Bge f. alba. These changes were due to reallocation of the metabolic flow, which was influenced by the SmANS gene. These findings indicate that SmANS not only plays a key role in anthocyanin accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza, but also acts as a "switch" for the coloration of S. miltiorrhiza Bge f. alba. This study provides baseline information for further research on flavonoids metabolism and improvement of anthocyanin or phenolic acid production by genetic engineering.
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) confers an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk which accounts for much of the premature morbidity and mortality observed in this population. Alterations in vascular function and morphology leading to increased atherosclerotic burden are considered the main drivers of CVD in RA individuals with systemic inflammation playing a key role in the dysregulation of endothelial homeostasis and initiation of vascular injury. Dimethylarginines are endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and have emerged as novel, independent biomarkers of CVD in a wide range of conditions associated with vascular pathology. In RA several reports have demonstrated abnormal dimethylarginine metabolism attributable to various factors such as systemic inflammation, decreased degradation or upregulated synthesis. Although a causal relationship between dimethylarginines and vascular damage in RA has not been established, the tight interrelations between inflammation, dimethylarginines and endothelial dysfunction suggest that determination of dimethylarginine regulators may shed more light in the pathophysiology of the atherosclerotic process in RA and may also provide new therapeutic targets. The Alanine-Glyoxylate Aminotransferase 2 (AGTX2)-dependent pathway is a relatively recently discovered alternative pathway of dimethylarginine catabolism and its role on RA-related atherosclerotic disease is yet to be established. As factors affecting dimethylarginine concentrations linked to CVD risk and endothelial dysfunction are of prominent clinical relevance in RA, we present preliminary evidence that gene variants of AGTX-2 may influence dimethylarginine levels in RA patients and provide the rationale for larger studies in this field.
Of numerous genes regulated by retinoic acid (RA), CYP26A1 is the most inducible gene by RA. In this study, we have used a shortened construct form, E4, of the CYP26A1 gene promoter, in a promoter-less vector with either luciferase or red fluorescent protein (RFP) as the reporter gene and have tested its responses to retinoids in transfected HepG2 and HEK293T cells. The promoter responded linearly to a wide concentration range of RA in cells cotransfected with retinoic acid receptors. It also responded quantitatively to retinol and other retinoids. An isolated clonal line of HEK293T cells permanently transfected with the promoter driving the expression of RFP responded to both RA and retinol, and the responses could be measured by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The promoter was used to assess the retinoid activity of 3 novel synthetic retinoid analogues, as well as of the intact serum samples of rats. Among the synthetic retinoid analogues tested, EC23 is more potent than RA at lower concentrations and was more stable than RA. The retinoid activities could be measured in control rat serum samples and were increased in the serum of RA-treated rats. This system offers a biologically-based alternative to mass-based retinoid analysis.
In the mammalian testis, sustained spermatogenesis relies on spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs); their progeny either remain as stem cells (self-renewal) or proliferate and differentiate to enter meiosis in response to retinoic acid (RA). Here, we sought to uncover elusive mechanisms regulating a key switch fundamental to spermatogonial fate: the capacity of spermatogonia to respond to RA. Using the developing mouse testis as a model, we found that spermatogonia and precursor prospermatogonia exhibit a heterogeneous capacity to respond to RA with at least two underlying causes. First, progenitor spermatogonia are prevented from responding to RA by catabolic activity of cytochrome P450 family 26 enzymes. Second, a smaller subset of undifferentiated spermatogonia enriched for SSCs exhibit catabolism-independent RA insensitivity. Moreover, for the first time, we observed that precursor prospermatogonia are heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that exhibit the same differential RA responsiveness found in neonatal spermatogonia. We propose a novel model by which mammalian prospermatogonial and spermatogonial fates are regulated by their intrinsic capacity to respond (or not) to the differentiation signal provided by RA before, and concurrent with, the initiation of spermatogenesis.
Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni has various pharmacological actions, which includes antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities. The superoxide and consequently NADPH oxidase (Nox) are relevant targets involved in biological effects of Stevia. The presence of NADPH-containing superoxide-producing lipoprotein (suprol) in Stevia leaves has not yet been tested. The mechanism of producing superoxide radicals (O2-) by suprol was determined in vitro, which is associated with the electron transfer from NADPH in the composition of suprol by traces of transition metal ions (Fe3+ or Cu2+) to molecular oxygen, turning it into O2-. It is expected that the therapeutic efficacy of Stevia leaves is caused by specific activity of superoxide-producing lipoprotein fraction.
For the first time, from the dry leaves of Stevia the NADPH-containing superoxide-producing lipoprotein was isolated and purified. The specific content of suprol (milligrams in 1 g of Stevia leaves- mg/g) was determined after desalination of suprol and lyophilization.
According to the method provided, the specific content of the isolated suprol from Stevia's leaves was up to 4.5 ± 0.2 mg / g (yields up to 68.5 ± 4.7%, p &lt; 0.05, n = 6). Nox forms a stable complex with suprol. The optical absorption spectrum of the Nox-suprol complex represents the overlapping suprol and Nox spectra, with a certain background increase and characteristic features of optical absorption for Nox. Due to O2- producing capacity suprol-Nox complex discolors KMnO4 solutions, Coomassie brilliant blue, restores nitrotetrazolium blue to formazan and oxidizes epinephrine to adrenochrome. The oxidation activity of adrenaline is 50.3 ± 5.1 U / mg / ml (p &lt; 0.05, n = 6).
Superoxide-producing lipoprotein fraction-Nox complex from Stevia leaves (membranes) can modulate redox regulated signaling pathways and may play a positive role in type-2 diabetes by means of adrenaline oxidation mechanism.
Cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B member 1 (CYP26B1) regulates the concentration of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and plays a key role in germ cell differentiation by controlling local distribution of RA. The mechanisms regulating Cyp26b1 expression in postnatal Sertoli cells, the main components of the stem cell niche, are so far unknown. During gonad development, expression of Cyp26b1 is maintained by Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) and Sex-Determining Region Y Box-9 (SOX9), which ensure that RA is degraded and germ cell differentiation is blocked. Here, we show that the NOTCH target Hairy/Enhancer-of-Split Related with YRPW Motif 1 (HEY1), a transcriptional repressor, regulates germ cell differentiation via direct binding to the Cyp26b1 promoter and thus inhibits its expression in Sertoli cells. Further, using in vivo germ cell ablation, we demonstrate that undifferentiated type A spermatogonia are the cells that activate NOTCH signaling in Sertoli cells through their expression of the NOTCH ligand JAGGED-1 (JAG1) at stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, therefore mediating germ cell differentiation by a ligand concentration-dependent process. These data therefore provide more insights into the mechanisms of germ cell differentiation after birth and potentially explain the spatiotemporal RA pulses driving the transition between undifferentiated to differentiating spermatogonia.-Parekh, P. A., Garcia, T. X., Waheeb, R., Jain, V., Gandhi, P., Meistrich, M. L., Shetty, G., Hofmann, M.-C. Undifferentiated spermatogonia regulate Cyp26b1 expression through NOTCH signaling and drive germ cell differentiation.
Fasciolosis, a food- and waterborne infection caused by the trematodes Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, is recognized by WHO as a neglected zoonotic disease. Whereas F. hepatica is distributed worldwide in cooler climates, F. gigantica occurs mainly in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The southern Caucasus, with Armenia, is one of the most northern regions where both species occur and may produce hybrids. In this study, livestock in central Armenia was surveyed for fasciolosis, the causative species were determined and the genetic diversity of both species was estimated. Total prevalence in sheep (1794), cattle (324) and goats (9) was 21.2%, 15.7% and 44.4%, respectively. After morphological identification and sequencing of a mitochondrial (nad1) and a nuclear marker gene (28S rRNA), 62 collected specimens were allocated to F. hepatica (n = 55) and F. gigantica (n = 7). Intraspecific diversity was evaluated for the complete nad1 gene, resulting in 29 haplotypes of F. hepatica and six haplotypes of F. gigantica. Diversity was higher among F. gigantica than F. hepatica in the Armenian sample set, a difference that was confirmed analyzing available sequences for both species worldwide. Maximum genetic distance between haplotypes in global networks was 49 nucleotide steps for F. gigantica compared to 15 for F. hepatica. In the available sample sets, F. hepatica showed higher diversity in western Asia and the Middle East compared to Europe and eastern Asia, while for F. gigantica loosely structured clusters comprising mainly western/southern Asian and African haplotypes could be identified. A distinct clade comprising haplotypes from Zambia was basal in the phylogenetic tree. Biogeographical implications of these data are discussed.
Recent studies have underscored the critical role of retinoic acid (RA) in the development of lineage-committed CD4 and CD8 T cells in vivo. We have shown that under acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) inflammatory conditions, RA is upregulated in the intestine and is proinflammatory, as GVHD lethality was attenuated when donor allogeneic T cells selectively expressed a dominant negative RA receptor α that blunted RA signaling. RA can function in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, and as such, the host cell lineage responsible for the production of RA metabolism and the specific RA-metabolizing enzymes that potentiate GVHD severity are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that enhancing RA degradation in the host and to a lesser extent donor hematopoietic cells by overexpressing the RA-catabolizing enzyme CYP26A1 reduced GVHD. RA production is facilitated by retinaldehyde isoform-2 (RALDH2) preferentially expressed in dendritic cells (DCs). Conditionally deleted RA-synthesizing enzyme RALDH2 in host or to a lesser extent donor DCs reduced GVHD lethality. Improved survival in recipients with RALDH2-deleted DCs was associated with increased T cell death, impaired T effector function, increased regulatory T cell frequency, and augmented coinhibitory molecule expression on donor CD4+ T cells. In contrast, retinaldehydrogenase isoform-1 (RALDH1) is dominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, conditional host intestinal epithelial cells RALDH1 deletion failed to reduce GVHD. These data demonstrate the critical role of both donor and especially host RALDH2+ DCs in driving murine GVHD and suggest RALDH2 inhibition or CYP26A1 induction as novel therapeutic strategies to prevent GVHD.
The whole plant of Glycine tabacina (Labill.) Benth has been used as a traditional herbal medicine to treat rheumatism, ostealgia and nephritis in China. It is also one of the sources of the renowned native herbal medicine 'I-Tiao-Gung' in Taiwan.
This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effect of ethanol extract of G. tabacina (GTE) in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.
The chemical profile of GTE was analyzed by HPLC-UV. The CIA was induced in male Wistar rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen at tail root, back and ankle joints. The rats were orally administrated daily with GTE (1.11, 2.22 and 4.44 g dry weight of herb powder per kg body weight) from day 0 and continued for 30 days. Swelling volume and thickness of paw, arthritis index, X-radiographs and histopathological changes were examined to assess the severity of arthritis. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity and malonaldehyde (MDA) level were measured to preliminarily explore the possible mechanisms.
Oral administration of GTE significantly ameliorated the arthritic symptoms in CIA rat model, as indicated by the effects on paws swelling and arthritis index. X-radiographic analysis and histopathological examinations demonstrated that GTE effectively protected the bone and cartilage of joints from erosion, lesion and deformation. The efficacy of GTE treatment on CIA was comparable to that of indomethacin (positive drug). Besides, the overproduction of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was remarkably inhibited in the serum of all GTE treatment groups. The restoration of serum T-SOD activity and MDA level proved that GTE administration alleviated the oxidative stress in CIA rats.
GTE exhibited strong anti-CIA activity through inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidation in rats, suggesting its potential preventive and therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Serine proteinases in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis promastigotes were assessed in this work. This study included the investigation of the enzymatic activity of subcellular fractions obtained from benzamidine affinity chromatography, reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, and in silico assays of subcellular localization of subtilisin. Promastigote serine proteinases showed gelatinolytic activity with molecular masses of 43 kDa to 170 kDa in the cytosolic fraction and 67 kDa to 170 kDa in the membranous fraction. Serine proteinase activities were detected using N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-FR-AMC) and N-succinyl-l-alanine-l-phenylalanine-l-lysine 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-AFK-AMC) as substrates in the cytosolic fraction (Z-FR-AMC = 392 ± 30 µmol.min-1 mg of protein-1 and Suc-AFK-AMC = 252 ± 20 µmol.min-1 mg of protein-1) and in the membranous fraction (Z-FR-AMC = 53 ± 5 µmol.min-1 mg of protein-1 and Suc-AFK-AMC = 63.6 ± 6.5 µmol.min-1 mg of protein-1). Enzyme specificity was shown by inhibition with aprotinin (19% to 80% inhibition) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (3% to 69%), depending on the subcellular fraction and substrate. The expression of subtilisin (LbrM.13.0860 and LbrM.28.2570) and tryparedoxin peroxidase (LbrM.15.1080) genes was observed by the detection of RNA transcripts 200 bp, 162 bp, and 166 bp long, respectively. Subsequent in silico assays showed LbrM.13.0860 can be located in the cytosol and LbrM.28.2570 in the membrane of the parasite. Data obtained here show the subcellular distribution and expression of serine proteinases, including the subtilisin-like serine proteinases in L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes.
GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific Cyp26b1 knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of Cyp26b1 expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of Cyp26b1 in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.
For more than two centuries now, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is under investigation intending to discover successful treatment. Despite decades of scientific advances, RA is still representing a challenge for contemporary medicine. Current drug therapies allow to improve significantly the quality of life of RA patients; however, they are still insufficient to reverse tissue injury and are often generating side-effects. The difficulty arises from the considerable fluctuation of the clinical course of RA among patients, making the predictive prognosis difficult. More and more studies underline the profound influence of the neutrophil multifaceted functions in the pathogenesis of RA. This renewed interest in the complexity of neutrophil functions in RA offers new exciting opportunities for valuable therapeutic targets as well as for safe and well-tolerated RA treatments. In this review, we aim to update the recent findings on the multiple facets of neutrophils in RA, in particular their impact in promoting the RA-based inflammation through the release of the cytokine-like S100A8/A9 protein complex, as well as the importance of NETosis in the disease progression and development. Furthermore, we delve into the complex question of neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity and discuss the emerging role of miRNAs and epigenetic markers influencing the inflammatory response of neutrophils in RA and how they could constitute the starting point for novel attractive targets in RA therapy.
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a most common progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown etiology, although majority of patients are elderly male smokers. The main pathogenesis is aberrant recovery of epithelial injury and collagen deposition. Fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, connective tissue disease (CTD) especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated ILD, and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia(CHP) are important differential diagnosis. Main symptoms are non-productive cough and progressive exertional dyspnea. Crucial physical findings are scalene muscle hypertrophy, bibasilar fine crackles, and finger clubbing. The serum markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) are sensitive for ILD detection and activity. Both pulmonary function test (PFT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) are useful tool for evaluation of disease progression of IPF. Serial changes of forced vital capacity (FVC) and 6MWT distance predict mortality in IPF effectively. Recently published international IPF guidelines highlight the importance of chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings such as honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis (TBE), and sub-pleural reticular opacity. IPF is chronic and progressive; therefore, tracking disease behavior is crucial. Unifying clinical, physiological, and imaging information over time is useful. With regard to its management, two anti-fibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone and nintedanib have been available. These drugs can slow the decline of FVC and prevent acute exacerbation (AE). In this review, I outline the clinical characteristics of IPF, physiological, imaging, pathological findings and review diagnosis process and management.
High concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) are routinely used during anesthesia, and supplemental oxygen is also administered in connection with several other clinical conditions. Although prolonged hyperoxia is known to cause acute lung injury (ALI), whether short-duration hyperoxia causes lung toxicity remains unknown. We exposed mice to room air (RA or 21% O2) or 60% oxygen alone or in combination with 2% isoflurane for 2 h and determined the expression of oxidative stress marker genes, DNA damage and DNA repair genes, and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins using quantitative PCR and Western analyses. Furthermore, we determined cellular apoptosis using TUNEL assay and assessed the DNA damage product 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG) in the urine of 60% hyperoxia-exposed mice. Our study demonstrates that short-duration hyperoxia causes mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage and that isoflurane abrogates this DNA damage and decreases apoptosis when used in conjunction with hyperoxia. In contrast, isoflurane mixed with RA caused significant 8-Oxo-dG accumulations in the mitochondria and nucleus. We further show that whereas NADPH oxidase is a major source of superoxide anion generated by isoflurane in normoxia, isoflurane inhibits superoxide generation in hyperoxia. Additionally, isoflurane also protected the mouse lungs against ALI (95% O2 for 36-h exposure). Our study established that short-duration hyperoxia causes genotoxicity in the lungs, which is abrogated when hyperoxia is used in conjunction with isoflurane, but isoflurane alone causes genotoxicity in the lung when delivered with ambient air.
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which oxidative stress could play a substantial pathological role. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) has been known as a "universal" and "ideal" antioxidant. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of oral administration of Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant biomarkers in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. 70 RA patients were randomized 1:1 to two groups using blocked randomization method and received 1200 mg/day ALA or placebo for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after the intervention to analyze total antioxidant capacity (TAC), antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and arylesterase (ARE) activities] and malondialdehyde (MDA). We observed significant increase in serum TAC (0.11 mmol/L; p=0.033) and ARE (13.76 U/mL; p=0.046) and significant decline in MDA (-0.36 nmol/L; p=0.002), in ALA group. However, these changes in ALA-treated group were not statistically significant when compared with placebo-treated group (p &gt; 0.05). Also, within- and between-group differences of whole blood SOD and GSH-Px were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, unexpectedly, ALA therapy did not affect the oxidative status of RA patients in the present clinical trial. It seems that more comprehensive clinical trials in RA patients are still warranted to clarify the effectiveness of ALA which has been known as a potent antioxidant.
Objective: An anti-carbamylated albumin antibody was detected in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and its presence was associated with serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, as we reported previously. Since MPO is a key enzyme for carbamylation and is released by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we aimed to demonstrate that NETosis induces carbamylation.Methods: Human neutrophils were isolated from a healthy donor, pre-treated with or without diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, an inhibitor for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)), Cl-amidine (a peptidylarginine deiminase inhibitor), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH, an MPO inhibitor), or GW311616A (a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor), and incubated for 8 h with or without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Proteins in the medium were collected and the carbamylation of albumin was evaluated by Western blotting.Results: The carbamylation of albumin was detected in the culture medium of activated neutrophils. NETosis was observed under the stimulation by PMA. DPI and 4-ABAH inhibited the carbamylation of albumin and NETosis. GW311616A inhibited NETosis, but not carbamylation. Neither carbamylation nor NETosis was inhibited by Cl-amidine.Conclusion: Activated neutrophils may carbamylate ambient albumin, and this is dependent on ROS and MPO, but does not require NETosis.
The present study looked for variation in the miRNA-24 sequence, and evaluated the associations between the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene-829 C-T polymorphism and plasma DHFR concentrations with response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment in Mexican patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
A total of 135 women with RA were classified as responders (disease activity score [DAS28] &lt;3.2) or nonresponders to MTX (DAS28 &gt; 3.2). We determined the genotype of the patients using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Plasma DHFR enzyme levels and mi-RNA24 sequences were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Allelic frequencies and the genotypic distribution of the polymorphism were analyzed by the chi-square test.
The genotype frequencies of the DHFR -829C-T polymorphism among responders were 37.0% CC, 52.1% CT, and 10.9% TT and for nonresponders were 33.9% CC, 56.4% CT, and 9.7% TT. No significant differences in genotype frequencies were found between the groups (p = 0.88). The DHFR levels relative to genotype for responders were 6.8 ± 2.7, 6.1 ± 2.7, and 6.5 ± 1.5 ng/mL for CC, CT, and TT, respectively, and for nonresponders were 6.5 ± 2.0, 6.1 ± 3.1, and 7.4 ± 1.8 ng/mL for CC, CT, and TT, respectively. No significant differences were found between the two groups. Similarly, both groups showed no sequence variations in miRNA-24 gene.
The -829C-T polymorphism of DHFR gene was not associated with response to MTX by RA patients, and no variations were found in the miRNA-24 sequence that might modify the response to treatment or DHFR enzyme levels in a Mexican population with RA.
Ethanol (EtOH) is a teratogen, but its teratogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. The alcohol form of vitamin A (retinol/ROL) can be oxidized to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), which plays a critical role in stem cell differentiation and development. Using an embryonic stem cell (ESC) model to analyze EtOH's effects on differentiation, we show here that EtOH and acetaldehyde, but not acetate, increase differentiation-associated mRNA levels, and that EtOH decreases pluripotency-related mRNAs. Using reporter assays, ChIP assays, and retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARγ) knockout ESC lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and homologous recombination, we demonstrate that EtOH signals via RARγ binding to RA response elements (RAREs) in differentiation-associated gene promoters or enhancers. We also report that EtOH-mediated increases in homeobox A1 (Hoxa1) and cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp26a1) transcripts, direct RA target genes, require the expression of the RA-synthesizing enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 (Aldh1a2), suggesting that EtOH-mediated induction of Hoxa1 and Cyp26a1 requires ROL from the serum. As shown with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lines, the retinol dehydrogenase gene Rdh10 and a functional RARE in the ROL transporter stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (Stra6) gene are required for EtOH induction of Hoxa1 and Cyp26a1 We conclude that EtOH stimulates stem cell differentiation by increasing the influx and metabolism of ROL for downstream RARγ-dependent transcription. In stem cells, EtOH may shift cell fate decisions to alter developmental outcomes by increasing endogenous ROL/RA signaling via increased Stra6 expression and ROL oxidation.
BACKGROUND Literature shows that serum selenium concentration is low in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Biochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) are depend in its medium dispersed. Biochemical properties could effectively alter the therapeutic potential of NPs. Phytochemicals could serve as suitable medium for dispersion of NPs. P-Coumaric acid (CA) known to have anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present experiment, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of SeNPs dispersed in 1% CA against Complete Freund's adjuvant induced RA. Celecoxib was used as a reference drug. RESULTS Selenium NPs (SeNPs) size is maintained in 1% CA solution. We observed that supplementation with 500 μg/Kg body weight (b.w.) eNPs significantly restored the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, COX-2 activity, different antioxidant enzyme activities, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) in RA rats. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, ECSOD, CAT, and GPx1 was found to be downregulated, whereas COX-2 was upregulated in RA rats; however, the mRNA expression of CAT, GPx1, and COX-2 reverted back to near normal levels in SeNPs-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic potential of SeNPs was confirmed through histological observation of angle joints in different experimental animals. Our results collectively suggest that SeNPs dispersed in CA can be an effective therapeutic agent for inflammatory disorders like acute gouty arthritis.
Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by expansion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in inflamed joints and activation of lymphocytes. Tryptophan (trp) is an essential amino acid indispensable for the biosynthesis of proteins and critical for survival of lymphocytes. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that initiates the degradation of trp and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TTS) essential for tryptophan synthesis, regulate trp bioavailability. Here, we tested the hypothesis that triggered by cytokines, enhanced IDO activity modulate regulatory function of otherwise non-tolerogenic FLS isolated from RA patients. Materials and methods: IDO and TTS mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR. IDO enzymatic activity was confirmed using HPLC. Resting or PHA-activated PBMC from healthy volunteers and RA patients were co-cultured with IDO expressing untreated (FLSC) or IFNγ-treated (FLSIFNγ) RA FLS. Lymphocyte survival and proliferation were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis and tritiated thymidine incorporation, respectively. Results: RA FLSIFNγ produce functionally active IDO and constitutively express TTS. RA FLSC and FLSIFNγ increased survival of resting lymphocytes in both studied groups, and decreased proliferation of healthy, but not RA, PBMC. Only FLSIFNγ diminished survival of activated CD3+CD4-, but not CD3+CD4+, healthy T cells and similar tendency was observed in rheumatoid cells. Importantly, IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan (1-MT), failed to reverse this effect. PBMC, irrespective of their state (resting versus activated) or origin (healthy or RA), expressed high level of TTS mRNA. Conclusions: We suggest that RA FLS express functionally active IDO but control survival and expansion of healthy cells in IDO-independent mechanism and exert weaker, if any, suppressive effect on rheumatoid cells.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that plays a crucial role as a regulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses and takes part in the destructive process of the joint in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by promoting angiogenesis and inducing proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). We evaluated if recombinant human MIF (rhMIF) induces the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL- 17F in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RA patients and control subjects (CS).
The PBMC from RA patients and CS were stimulated for 24 hours with combinations of LPS, rhMIF or the MIF antagonist ISO-1. Cytokine profiles were measured using a multiplex immunoassay and, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was determined by ELISA kit.
The PBMC of CS and RA produced Th1 and Th17 cytokines under stimulation with rhMIF, however, this effect was higher in the cells of RA patients. The rhMIFstimulated PBMC from RA patients produced higher levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in comparison with unstimulated cells: TNF-α (538.81 vs. 5.02 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), IFN-γ (721.90 vs. 8.40 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), IL-1β (150.14 vs. 5.17 pg/mL, p&lt;0.05), IL-6 (19769.70 vs. 119.85 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001), IL-17A (34.97 vs. 0.90 pg/mL, p&lt;0.01) and IL-17F (158.43 vs. 0.92 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001).
These results highlight the potential role of MIF in the establishment of the chronic inflammatory process in RA via Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile induction and provide new evidence of the role of MIF to stimulate the IL-17A and IL-17F expression in PBMC from RA and CS.
Various factors are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and ethanol-mediated carcinogenesis. In addition to genetic, epigenetic and immunologic mechanisms, acetaldehyde-associated toxicity, oxidative stress as well as cytokine-mediated inflammation are of major importance. Oxidative stress, with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), develops either in inflammation (alcoholic hepatitis) or during oxidation of ethanol via cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1). CYP2E1 is induced by ethanol, oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, and generates ROS during this process. ROS results in protein damage, enhanced fibrogenesis and DNA lesions. Furthermore, CYP2E1 induction results in an enhanced activation of various procarcinogens and an increased degradation of retinol and retinoic acid (RA), a compound responsible for cell differentiation and proliferation. An inhibition of CYP2E1 results in an improvement of ALD and chemically induced carcinogenesis in animal experiments. In humans, CYP2E1 is induced following the consumption of 40 grams of ethanol per day after one week. However, the induction varies inter-individually. The mechanism for this is still unclear. Patients with ALD show a significant correlation between CYP2E1, the occurrence of highly carcinogenic etheno DNA adducts and the severity of fibrosis. First results on the effect of CYP2E1 inhibition by chlormethiazole, a specific CYP2E1 inhibitor on ALD, can be expected soon.
Verschiedene Faktoren sind in der Pathogenese der alkoholischen Lebererkrankung (ALE) und der alkoholvermittelten Karzinogenese beteiligt. Neben genetischen, epigenetischen und immunologischen Mechanismen spielen die toxische Wirkung von Acetaldehyd, oxidativer Stress und zytokinvermittelte Entzündungen eine wesentliche Rolle. Oxidativer Stress mit der Generierung von reaktiven Sauerstoffspezies (ROS) entsteht entweder in der Entzündung (alkoholische Hepatitis) oder bei der Alkoholoxidation via Cytochrom P4502E1 (CYP2E1). CYP2E1 wird durch Alkohol induziert, oxidiert Äthanol zu Acetaldehyd und generiert dabei ROS. ROS führt unter anderem zu Proteinschädigung, Fibrogenese und DNA-Mutationen. Weiterhin resultiert die CYP2E1-Induktion in einer gesteigerten Prokarzinogenaktivierung und einem verstärkten Abbau von Retinol und Retinsäure, einem Faktor, der für eine geordnete Zelldifferenzierung und Zellproliferation verantwortlich ist. Eine Hemmung von CYP2E1 führt zu einer Verbesserung der ALE und zu einer Hemmung der chemisch induzierten Karzinogenese im Tierexperiment. Beim Menschen wird CYP2E1 bereits bei 40 Gramm Alkohol pro Tag innerhalb einer Woche induziert, jedoch gibt es signifikante interindividuelle Unterschiede. Der Mechanismus dafür ist unklar. Bei Patienten mit ALE korreliert CYP2E1 mit dem Ausmaß von hochkarzinogenen Etheno-DNA-Addukten in Leber und Ösophagus und mit der Schwere der Leberfibrose. Erste Ergebnisse zu einer Hemmung von CYP2E1 durch Chlormethiazol, einem spezifischen CYP2E1-Hemmer, bei Patienten mit ALE sind in Kürze zu erwarten.
The present study was undertaken to determine whether extracellular calreticulin (CRT) participates in the regulation of ICAM-1in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and further explore the potential mechanism. Our results showed that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels were positively correlated with CRT levels in RA serum and synovial fluid, respectively. In RA synovial tissue, increased co-expressions of CRT and ICAM-1 in vascular endothelium and perivascular areas and elevated co-location of CRT and VCAM-1 localized predominantly to lining layer were observed compared to those in OA. In in vitro HUVECs model, enhanced ICAM-1expression and increased phosphorylation levels of Akt and eNOS were detected in the presence of CRT. Increased phosphorylated eNOS was significantly inhibited by a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and elevated ICAM-1expression was partially blocked by the inhibitors of both PI3K and eNOS (L-NAME). It has been certified that the RNA-binding protein TTP targets AU-rich elements in the ICAM-1 3'-UTR and suppresses ICAM-1 expression. Knocking down TTP in HUVECs led to an increased induction of ICAM-1 by CRT. We have currently known that activation of p38 downstream kinase MK-2 leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of human TTP. The block of p38 MAPK/MK-2 signaling led to decreased protein expression and mRNA stability of TTP and ICAM-1. Furthermore, L-NAME and/or LY294002 pre-treated HUVECs manifested decreased p38 and MK-2 phosphorylation, which was accompanied by reduced TTP and ICAM-1 protein expression as well as decreased mRNA stability. Our results suggested that CRT could promote ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells through PI3K/Akt/eNOS/p38 MAPK signaling mediated TTP accumulation, probably in an inactive form, which may provide a possible proinflammatory mechanism of CRT in RA.
BACKGROUND RAW264.7 cells are induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model. The present study investigated the effect of cimifugin on the proliferation, migration, chemotaxis, and release of inflammation-related factors and inflammation-related signaling pathways of LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS MTS assay was used to determine the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells. Transwell assay was employed to examine the migration and chemotaxis of the cells. ELISA was performed to measure the contents of chemotactic factors and inflammatory factors in cell culture supernatants. Western blotting was carried out to detect the expression of factors related with MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways. RESULTS Cimifugin (0-100 mg/L) had no cytotoxicity for RAW264.7 cells. LPS stimulation induced morphological differentiation of RAW264.7 cells, but intervention by cimifugin inhibited the activation effect by LPS by about 50%. Cimifugin (100 mg/L) decreased the migration and chemotaxis of RAW264.7 cells to 1/3 of that in control cells by decreasing the release of migration- and chemotaxis-associated factors by at least 30%. Cimifugin (100 mg/L) suppressed the release of inflammatory factors from RAW264.7 cells to less than 60% of that in the LPS group. In addition, cimifugin (100 mg/L) inhibited the activities of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that cimifugin reduces the migration and chemotaxis of RAW264.7 cells and inhibits the release of inflammatory factors and activation of related signaling pathways induced by LPS. Cimifugin may have potential pharmacological effects against RA.
The process of neuronal differentiation is associated with neurite elongation and membrane biogenesis, and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is the major membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells. During neuroblast differentiation, the transcription of two genes involved in PtdCho biosynthesis are stimulated: Chka gene for choline kinase (CK) alpha isoform and Pcyt1a gene for CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) alpha isoform. Here we show that CKα is essential for neuronal differentiation. In addition, we demonstrated that KDM2B regulates CKα expression and, as a consequence, neuronal differentiation. This factor is up-regulated in the course of the neuroblasts proliferative and undifferentiated state and down-regulated during differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). During proliferation, KDM2B binds to the Box2 located in the Chka promoter repressing its transcription. Interestingly, KDM2B knockdown enhances the levels of CKα expression in neuroblast cells and induces neuronal differentiation even in the absence of RA. These results suggest that KDM2B is required for the appropriate regulation of CKα during neuronal differentiation and to the maintaining of the undifferentiated stage of neuroblast cells.
To study the performance of a clinical pharmacogenetic model for the prediction of nonresponse in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) in combination with other synthetic or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs . This prediction model includes gender, smoking status, rheumatoid factor positivity and four genetic variants in AMPD1 (rs17602729), ATIC (rs2372536), ITPA (rs1127354) and MTHFD1 (rs17850560).
A total of 314 RA patients from three Dutch studies were retrospectively included. Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with RA and had a treatment duration with MTX and follow-up for at least two study evaluation visits. Prediction model risk scores at the first and second evaluation were calculated and compared with the actual nonresponse (disease activity score &gt;2.4). Regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of the prediction model were performed. Also, the sensitivity, specificity and the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were determined.
The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 75% at first and 70% after second evaluation. At the second evaluation, prediction nonresponse had a sensitivity of 67% (CI: 54-78%), specificity of 69% (CI: 60-77%), PPV of 52% (CI: 45-60%) and NPV of 80% (CI: 73-85%).
This study demonstrates that the clinical pharmacogenetic model has an inadequate performance for the prediction of nonresponse to MTX in RA patients treated with combination therapies.
Objective: Currently, no guidelines are established for pharmacogenomic testing involving folate metabolic genes in long-term disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs' (DMARD) therapies. We carefully investigated how common genetic variations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) influence cellular metabolic kinetics in response to methotrexate (MTX). Designs: Two distinct cell models: HepG2 with stabilized MTHFR inhibition using shRNA delivered by a Lentiviral vector; and Epstein-Barr virus transformed human lymphoblasts expressing MTHFR polymorphic allele 677C and 677T were used. Disease activity and DMARD use were compared between MTHFR-677CC, CT and TT rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in a cross-sectional study (n=120). Results: Compared with MTHFR-CC, MTHFR-TT carriers had lower mean weakly MTX dose (9.8 ± 3.3 compared with 12.1 ± 3.5, P&lt;0.05). More MTHFR-TT carriers (8/11, 73%) reported MTX-related side effects compared with MTHFR-677CC (32/57, 56%) and MTHFR-677CT (30/51, 59%). No genotypic difference was found in other DMARDs. At the same dose of MTX, lymphoblasts were more sensitive in cell survival, protein and thymidine syntheses whereas HepG2 models were more susceptible to the inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine (adoMet) synthesis. MTHFR-C677T altered protein turnover and folate mediated 1-carbon metabolic fluxes in lymphoblasts with and without MTX. MTHFR function significantly affected transmethylation fluxes and adoMet homeostasis but not nucleotide biosyntheses in MTX-treated HepG2 cell-lines. Conclusion: Combining cell models, kinetic studies, and genetic tests in humans, the present study gives insight on how MTHFR effects hepatic transmethylation homeostasis during MTX therapy. We provide platforms that help predict the genetic impact on antifolate drugs, and further delineate tissue-specific target pathway in DMARD therapies. We suggest that genetic factors should be taken into account in clinical practice.
Rosmarinic acid (RA) has antioxidation, anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and various biological functions. In our study, we aim to evaluate effects of RA on acute liver injury caused by LPS and d-galactosamine (d-GalN) and its underlying molecular mechanism in mice. Our findings showed that RA could protect C57BL/6 mice from LPS/d-GalN-induced acute liver injury, which not only reflected on declining aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of the serum, but also restrained the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 protein expression and the content of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) elevation. Moreover, RA could enhance the level of glutathione-dependent peroxidase (GSH-PX). Furthermore, RA promoted that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transported into nucleus, and then up-regulated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM) and quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). These results indicated that RA could protect the mice from acute liver injury induced by LPS/d-GalN.
Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is the anchor drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is inexpensive, effective, and generally safe. When clinical response is inadequate, biological therapies are commonly used in combination with MTX. However, biological agents have safety concerns (i.e. infections, malignancy) and the addition of a biologic agent is expensive, making strategies to improve MTX efficacy important. Inhibition of pathways of folate metabolism involving purine metabolism by MTX, have been traditionally emphasized as important in MTX efficacy. However, inhibition MTX catabolism may also be important. MTX is irreversibly hydroxylated to form 7-hydroxy methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (AOX). Catabolism of MTX to 7-OH-MTX is the first metabolic process imposed on an oral dose of MTX and will alter subsequent interactions of MTX with other enzymes. 7-OH-MTX is less potent than MTX in the treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis. RA patients with a low capacity to catabolize MTX to 7-OH-MTX do better clinically than individuals who are rapid formers of 7-OH-MTX. Therefore, altering the catabolism of MTX may be an innovative way to improve MTX efficacy. Raloxifene is a FDA-approved therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for the reduction of invasive breast cancers but has no known activity in RA. Raloxifene is a potent inhibitor of human liver AOX. Postmenopausal women with RA frequently have low bone mineral density and would be candidates for raloxifene and MTX combination therapy. The effect of raloxifene on MTX metabolism has never been studied. Our hypothesis is that in postmenopausal women with RA and osteoporosis treated with MTX and raloxifene, the inhibition of AOX with resultant decreased formation of 7-OH MTX; will increase MTX levels and improve MTX efficacy. This hypothesis could be studied in an open-label, proof of concept clinical study in individuals before and after the addition of raloxifene. Red blood cell MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels and RA disease activity (DAS28) would be measured. In possible future studies, there are dietary substances, as supplements, (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate in green tea and resveratrol) which inhibit human liver AOX which could be evaluated.
Methotrexate (MTX), a folate analogue, is the most commonly used disease-modifying drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, high interindividual differences in drug response are present among RA patients.
In a group of 234 RA patients treated with MTX, we investigated whether rs1650697 polymorphism in DHFR gene may have an impact on MTX efficacy and/or adverse drug effects (ADEs). Relative DAS28 values (rDAS28) were used for the estimation of MTX therapy and all ADEs were recorded. Patients were genotyped for selected polymorphism by real-time PCR method.
According to the European League Against Rheumatism criteria after 6 months of MTX therapy, 196 patients (83.8%) were classified as responders (25 (10.7%) were good and 171 (73.1%) were moderate) and 38 patients (16.2%) as nonresponders. ADEs were observed in 55 patients (23.5%).
Our results showed that the presence of T allele might be protective against MTX hepatotoxicity measured by transaminase levels (p = 0.05). Furthermore, among patients who also received low-dose corticosteroids, we have found a lower rDAS value in patients with CC genotype (p = 0.039).
Retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A metabolite, regulates transcriptional programs that drive protective or pathogenic immune responses in the intestine, in a manner dependent on RA concentration. Vitamin A is obtained from diet and is metabolized by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which operate in intimate association with microbes and immune cells. Here we found that commensal bacteria belonging to class Clostridia modulate RA concentration in the gut by suppressing the expression of retinol dehydrogenase 7 (Rdh7) in IECs. Rdh7 expression and associated RA amounts were lower in the intestinal tissue of conventional mice, as compared to germ-free mice. Deletion of Rdh7 in IECs diminished RA signaling in immune cells, reduced the IL-22-dependent antimicrobial response, and enhanced resistance to colonization by Salmonella Typhimurium. Our findings define a regulatory circuit wherein bacterial regulation of IEC-intrinsic RA synthesis protects microbial communities in the gut from excessive immune activity, achieving a balance that prevents colonization by enteric pathogens.
The mechanisms of action of MTX (methotrexate) in the treatment of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and PsA (psoriatic arthritis) is related to its antifolic activity, due to the high affinity for enzymes that require folate cofactors as dihydrofolate reductase and to the anti-inflammatory activity derivated from the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase that leads to the over-production of adenosine.
Our patient was a 41-year-old female, affected by PsA in treatment since 2 years with low-dose methylprednisolone and low-dose subcutaneous MTX. The treatment was effective. The patient subacutely developed a severe paraparesis with impossibility of gait or standing without aid and was admitted to a Neurology Department where the cause of the paraparesis was not clear in spite of accurate radiological neurophysiologic and laboratory tests. Therefore, she was admitted in a rehabilitation unit.
Paraparesis in PsA patient in treatment with methotrexate. MTX toxicity was hypothesized; therefore the drug was discontinued while i.m. folic acid and cyanocobalamin were administered for 20 days. The diagnosis was clinical, based on neurological examination (paraparesis) and on the chronic use of MTX (hypothesis of toxicity).
The patient obtained a complete resolution of paraparesis. Genetic analyses showed associated a compound heterozygosity for the c.1298A&gt;C and c.677C&gt;T variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene.
Neurological side effects of MTX are uncommon. In literature no previous case of MTX induced paraparesis in patients treated with low-dose MTX for chronic arthritis has been described. The association between the gene polymorphisms of MTHFR (c.1298A&gt;C and c.677C&gt;T) and MTX toxicity in arthritis patients is confirmed. The case also confirms that folates are a precious antidote of MTX toxicity.
Growing data have indicated that the miR-17-92 cluster is implicated in inflammatory response and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was aimed to investigate the effects of miR-92a on the proliferation and migration of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). Our results showed that miR-92a was significantly down-regulated in RA synovial tissue and RA-FLSs, whereas the protein level of AKT2 is increased. Restoration of miR-92a suppressed the proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs. Down-regulation of miR-92a promotes proliferation and migration of normal human FLSs. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-92a could specifically bind with the 30UTR of AKT2 and significantly repressed the luciferase activity. Down-regulation or up-regulation of miR-92a significantly increased or decreased the protein and phosphorylation levels of AKT2. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of AKT2 significantly prevented cell proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs, which were similar to the effects induced by overexpression of miR-92a. Moreover, AKT2 overexpression rescued miR-92a-mediated suppressive effect on proliferation and migration of RA-FLS. Thus, miR-92a could inhibit the proliferation and migration of RA-FLSs through regulation of AKT2 expression.
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-FLSs) play a key role in cartilage destruction. We previously found that resveratrol (Res) could promote FLSs apoptosis in adjuvant arthritis rats, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. According to our latest study, Res can suppress the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and RA-FLSs proliferation. It was associated with elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. Therefore, we hypothesized that Res-mediated RA-FLSs apoptosis might occur via the MnSOD- mitochondrial reactive oxygen species pathway. RA-FLSs were infected with lentiviruses and screened with puromycin at a concentration of 8 µg/ml. We divided the RA-FLSs into four groups: a control group, a negative control (NC) group, a MnSOD overexpression group, and a MnSOD RNAi group. The four groups of RA-FLSs were tested using confocal laser scanning microscopy, CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting were conducted to determine the involvement of the MnSOD-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species pathway. Compared with the NC group, the MnSOD overexpression group treated with different concentrations of Res (0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 μM) and 5 μM H2O2 showed reduced levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, increased B-cell-lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), reduced Bcl-2 Associated X protein (Bax), and fewer apoptotic cells. The MnSOD RNAi group showed the opposite results. Thus, we concluded that Res could facilitate RA-FLSs apoptosis by regulating MnSOD expression and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. Our findings show a novel mechanism for the beneficial effects of Res, especially in relation to the MnSOD-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species signaling pathway in RA.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF induces IL-17 secretion and MIF promoter polymorphisms influence the expression of selected downstream mediators. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between known functional MIF haplotypes and Th17-related cytokine secretion profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from control subjects (CS) and RA patients stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recombinant human MIF (rhMIF). The -794 CATT5-8 and -173G &gt; C polymorphisms of the MIF gene were determined by conventional PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. The most frequent haplotypes of the MIF polymorphism and PBMC were identified from three subjects homozygous for each haplotype and in both study groups, the PBMC were obtained and stimulated with LPS or rhMIF. The secretion of cytokines related to the Th17 profile was determined by a multiplex immunoassay (MAGPIX). LPS stimulation induced the secretion of cytokines related to the Th17 profile in PBMC from CS and RA patients, whereas, rhMIF only stimulated this response in PBMC from RA patients. PBMC from CS carriers of the MIF 7C haplotype showed more IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23 secretion than non-7C carriers after LPS stimulation. In the case of rhMIF stimulation, the PBMC from CS carriers of the 7C haplotype secreted more IL-17A and IL-23 than non-7C carriers. In conclusion, genetic variants of the MIF promoter modulate the secretion of cytokines related to the Th17 profile in PBMC from CS inducing a differential response in comparison to PBMC from RA patients.
In light of the widespread use of herbal medicines containing rosmarinic acid (RA) and limited literature available thereon, we investigated the metabolic interactions of RA with human cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). The involvement of selected enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP3 A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT2B7) in the metabolism of RA and the inhibitory effect of RA on the enzyme activity were comprehensively evaluated using human recombinant isozyme system. Additionally, concentration-dependent RA metabolism mediated by phase I enzymes (including CYPs) or UGT was investigated in human liver microsome (HLM) system. A significant disappearance of RA was observed in the seven CYP and UGT isoforms studied, indicating their possible involvement in the metabolism of RA. Based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the metabolism study using HLM suggests that the UGT system may have a higher capacity and lower affinity for the metabolism of RA than phase I enzyme (including CYP) systems. Moreover, RA weakly inhibited CYP2C9 and 2E1 activities with IC50 values of 39.6 and 61.0 μM, respectively, while moderately inhibiting UGT1A1, 1A6, and 2B7 with IC50 values of 9.24, 19.1, and 23.4 μM, respectively. By constructing Line weaver-Burk plots, the type of inhibition exhibited by RA on CYP and UGT activities was determined as follows: CYP2C19, mixed inhibition; CYP2E1, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT2B7, competitive inhibition. Based on the comparison of the IC50 and Ki values obtained in the current study with the previously reported plasma concentrations of RA after oral dosing in humans, it is suggested that RA may significantly inhibit the activities of the tested UGTs, rather than CYPs, in clinical settings. Thus, the present study could provide a basis for further studies on clinically significant interactions between UGT substrate drugs and herbal medicines containing RA.
People suffering from malnutrition become susceptible to the infection like Leishmania sp., as it results in a compromised immune response. Retinoic acid (RA), an important constituent of nutrition, shows an immune-modulatory activity. However, its role in the containment of infection is not yet ascertained, particularly in case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL patients (n = 10) and healthy endemic controls (n = 9) were recruited to measure the serum levels of RA. An in vitro model of Leishmania infection using the murine mφ cell line J774.1 was used to investigate the RA-synthesizing enzymes (RALDH-1 and RALDH-2). Parasite loads among infected mφ were measured by quantitative expression of kDNA in the presence of an inhibitor of the RALDH-2 enzyme. We found a significant decrease in the serum levels of RA in VL cases. Importantly, we observed decreased levels of RALDH-1 and RALDH-2 among L. donovani-infected mφ along with simultaneous decrease as well as increase in the Th-1 and Th-2-associated factors, respectively. Furthermore, the pretreatment of mφ with an RALDH-2 inhibitor improved parasite in vitro infection. Our findings show impaired RA pathway among infected mφ and indicate that an intact RA pathway is critical for anti-Leishmania immune response. Graphical abstract ᅟ.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune polyarthritis with progressive destruction of the synovial joints associated with systemic manifestations. RA is characterized by infiltration of the synovial joints with inflammatory immune cells with premature immunosenescence. Shorter telomere length in the peripheral blood cells and increase in the oxidative stress have been detected in patients with RA. The aim of the present study was to study the association of markers of telomere shortening and oxidative stress with RA disease activity. Sixty-one RA patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Demographic data, clinical examination, and disease activity status were evaluated for the RA patients. Serum levels of chitinase and NAG (telomere markers) were determined by biochemical reactions using colloidal chitin and NAG as substrates, respectively. Nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase (oxidative stress markers) were determined colometrically and spectrophotometrically, respectively, in the sera of RA patients and controls. Results were correlated with disease activity. Indices of telomere shortening and oxidative markers were significantly higher in RA patients compared to controls. These indices were correlated with signs of disease activity (including number of swollen and tender joints, DAS-28, and inflammatory markers). Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which markers of telomere shortening and elevated oxidant stress correlate with disease activity.
Neutrophils are critical for the defense against pathogens, in part through the extrusion of extracellular DNA traps, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Neutrophils may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through the activation of protein arginine deiminases (PADs) that citrullinate proteins that subsequently act as autoantigens. We report that PAD4 is physically associated with the cytosolic subunits of the oxidative burst machinery, p47phox (also known as neutrophil cytosol factor 1, NCF1) and p67phox (NCF2). Activation of PAD4 by membranolytic insults that result in high levels of intracellular calcium (higher than physiological neutrophil activation) leads to rapid citrullination of p47phox/NCF1 and p67phox/NCF2, as well as their dissociation from PAD4. This dissociation prevents the assembly of an active NADPH oxidase complex and an oxidative burst in neutrophils stimulated by phorbol-ester or immune complexes. In further support of a substrate-to-inactive enzyme interaction, small-molecule PAD inhibitors also disrupt the PAD4-NCF complex and reduce oxidase activation and phagocytic killing of Staphylococcus aureus. This novel role of PAD4 in the regulation of neutrophil physiology suggests that targeting PAD4 with active site inhibitors for the treatment of RA may have a broader impact on neutrophil biology than just inhibition of citrullination.
During evolution, animals optimize their reproductive strategies to increase offspring survival. Seasonal breeders reproduce only during certain times of the year. In mammals, reproduction is tightly controlled by hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis. Although pathways regulating gametogenesis in non-seasonal model species have been well established, molecular insights into seasonal reproduction are severely limited. Using the Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), a small rodent animal species native to the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, as a model, here we report that seasonal spermatogenesis is governed at the level of spermatogonial differentiation. In testis of the reproductively dormant animals, undifferentiated spermatogonia failed to differentiate and accumulated in the seminiferous tubules. RNA-seq analyses of the active and dormant testes revealed that genes modulating retinoic acid biogenesis and steriodogenesis were differentially regulated. A single injection of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reinitiated spermatogenesis and inhibition the function of RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 for 10 days induced spermatogonial differentiation. Strikingly, testosterone injection reinitiated spermatogenesis in short day adapted animals. Testosterone provides a permissive environment of RA biogenesis and actions in testis, therefore, indirectly controls spermatogonial differentiation. Collectively, these findings provide a key mechanistic insight regarding the molecular regulation of seasonal reproduction in mammals.
The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate whether 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in steroid hormone-related genes are associated with the risk of RA and anti-TNF drug response. We conducted a case-control study in 3 European populations including 2936 RA patients and 2197 healthy controls. Of those, a total of 1985 RA patients were treated with anti-TNF blockers. The association of potentially interesting markers in the discovery population was validated through meta-analysis with data from DREAM and DANBIO registries. Although none of the selected variants had a relevant role in modulating RA risk, the meta-analysis of the linear regression data with those from the DREAM and DANBIO registries showed a significant correlation of the CYP3A4rs11773597 and CYP2C9rs1799853 variants with changes in DAS28 after the administration of anti-TNF drugs (P = 0.00074 and P = 0.006, respectively). An overall haplotype analysis also showed that the ESR2GGG haplotype significantly associated with a reduced chance of having poor response to anti-TNF drugs (P = 0.0009). Finally, a ROC curve analysis confirmed that a model built with eight steroid hormone-related variants significantly improved the ability to predict drug response compared with the reference model including demographic and clinical variables (AUC = 0.633 vs. AUC = 0.556; PLR_test = 1.52 × 10-6). These data together with those reporting that the CYP3A4 and ESR2 SNPs correlate with the expression of TRIM4 and ESR2 mRNAs in PBMCs (ranging from P = 1.98 × 10-6 to P = 2.0 × 10-35), and that the CYP2C9rs1799853 SNP modulates the efficiency of multiple drugs, suggest that steroid hormone-related genes may have a role in determining the response to anti-TNF drugs.KEY POINTS• Polymorphisms within the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 loci correlate with changes in DAS28 after treatment with anti-TNF drugs.• A haplotype including eQTL SNPs within the ESR2 gene associates with better response to anti-TNF drugs.• A genetic model built with eight steroid hormone-related variants significantly improved the ability to predict drug response.
A substantial literature supports antidiabetic properties of the lanosteryl triterpene (methyl-3β-hydroxylanosta-9,24-dien-21-oate, RA-3) isolated from Protorhus longifolia stem bark. However, the molecular mechanism(s) associated with the antihyperglycemic properties of the triterpene remained to be explored. The current study aimed at investigating the molecular mechanism(s) through which RA-3 improves insulin signaling in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats.
The type 1 diabetic rats were treated daily with a single oral dose of RA-3 (100 mg/kg) for 28 days. The rats were then sacrificed, and blood, skeletal muscle and pancreases were collected for biochemical, protein expression and histological analysis, respectively.
Persistently high blood glucose levels in the diabetic control rats significantly increased expression of IRS-1Ser307 while the expression of p-Akt Ser473, p-GSK-3β Ser9, GLUT 4 and GLUT 2 were decreased. However, enhanced muscle insulin sensitivity, which was indicated by a decrease in the expression of IRS-1ser307 with a concomitant increase in the p-AktSer473, p-GSK-3β Ser9, GLUT 4 and GLUT 2 expression were observed in the diabetic rats treated with RA-3. The triterpene-treated animals also showed an improved pancreatic β-cells morphology, along with increased C-peptide levels. An increase in the levels of serum antioxidants such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione was noted in the rats treated with the triterpene, while their serum levels of interleukin-6 and malondialdehyde were reduced.
It is apparent that RA-3 is able to improve the insulin signaling in type 1 diabetic rats. Its beta (β)-cells protecting mechanism could be attributed to its ability to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress in the cells.
To investigate the genetic background influencing the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which, after quality control and imputation, a total of 6,308,944 polymorphisms across the whole genome were analyzed in 2,989 RA patients of European origin. Data on subclinical atherosclerosis, obtained through assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and presence/absence of carotid plaques by carotid ultrasonography, were available for 1,355 individuals.
A genetic variant of the RARB gene (rs116199914) was associated with CIMT values at the genome-wide level of significance (minor allele [G] β coefficient 0.142, P = 1.86 × 10-8 ). Interestingly, rs116199914 overlapped with regulatory elements in tissues related to CV pathophysiology and immune cells. In addition, biologic pathway enrichment and predictive protein-protein relationship analyses, including suggestive GWAS signals of potential relevance, revealed a functional enrichment of the collagen biosynthesis network related to the presence/absence of carotid plaques (Gene Ontology no. 0032964; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 4.01 × 10-3 ). Furthermore, our data suggest potential influences of the previously described candidate CV risk loci NFKB1, MSRA, and ZC3HC1 (P = 8.12 × 10-4 , P = 5.94 × 10-4 , and P = 2.46 × 10-4 , respectively).
The present findings strongly suggest that genetic variation within RARB contributes to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA.
Lomefloxacin, an antibacterial agent with known photo-induced toxicity in clinical studies, is frequently detected in aquatic environments. Investigating the photo-induced toxicity of lomefloxacin in aquatic organisms is therefore of importance for assessing its ecological risks. In this study, the effects of lomefloxacin on survival, growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna under simulated sunlight radiation (SSR) were investigated, and the mechanism of action was revealed. Results indicated that SSR containing UV radiation increased the acute toxicity of lomefloxacin to Daphnia magna relative to white fluorescent light irradiation. Under SSR, 100 μM lomefloxacin significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation, and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. The biochemical observations and apparent effects on the organism indicate that oxidative stress plays a central role in the acute photo-induced toxicity. Chronic toxicity results showed that SSR significantly affected growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna, whereas lomefloxacin reduced the damage of UV radiation in SSR through light shielding. This study provides insight into the mechanism of photo-induced toxicity and can support the risk assessment of chemicals in the aquatic environment by including the impacts of sunlight irradiation on toxicity.
Minocycline is a lipophilic tetracycline of increasing appeal in neuroscience as it inhibits microglial activation, a mechanism involved in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Own data point towards retinoid-mediated effects of minocycline in murine brain and skin, and towards a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation which is driven by microglial activation-induced breakdown of local retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA). We therefore sought to study minocycline's anti-inflammatory effects on human microglial-like monocyte-derived cells in the context of retinoid signaling.
As hypothesized, minocycline exposure resulted in a substantial increase of RA levels in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. While pro-inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharides resulted in increased tryptophane-degrading indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase IDO-expression and TNF-α levels in primary human monocyte-derived microglial-like cells, this effect was attenuated by minocycline only in the presence of retinoids. The anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline on TNF-α expression were completely abolished by a pharmacological blockage of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) using BMS-493 and unaffected by selectively blocking retinoid-X-receptors using UVI-3003.
Our data indicate for the first time a RA-dependent, anti-inflammatory effect for minocycline in human microglial-like cells via inhibition of local RA turnover. The RA-dependent mode of action for minocycline appears to be predominantly mediated through RAR-signaling.
Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is the most common defect of mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. However, the unambiguous diagnosis of true VLCADD patients may be challenging, and a high rate of false positive individuals identified by newborn screening undergo confirmation diagnostics. In this study, we show the outcome of enzyme testing in lymphocytes as a confirmatory tool in newborns identified by screening, and the correlation with molecular sequencing of the ACADVL gene. From April 2013 to March 2017, in 403 individuals with characteristic acylcarnitine profiles indicative of VLCADD, palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was measured followed by molecular genetic analysis in most of the patients with residual activity (RA) &lt;50%. In almost 50% of the samples (209/403) the RA was &gt;50%, one-third of the individuals (125/403) displayed a RA of 30-50% and 69/403 individuals showed a residual activity of 0-30%. Sequencing of the ACADVL gene revealed that all individuals with activities below 24% were true VLCADD patients, individuals with residual activities between 24 and 27% carried either one or two mutations. Twenty new mutations could be identified and functionally classified based on their effect on enzyme function. Finally, we observed an up-regulation of MCAD-activity in many patients. However, this did not correlate with the degree of VLCAD RA. Although the likely clinical phenotype cannot be fully foreseen by genetic and functional tests as it depends on many factors, our data demonstrate the strength of this functional enzyme test in lymphocytes as a quick and reliable method for confirmation diagnostics of VLCADD.
Objective: To study the expression of dishevelled-2 (DVL2) in rheumatoid arthritis cartilage and its effect on cartilage destruction. Methods: Cartilage DVL2 expression in rat models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis(OA) and collagen-induced arthritis(CIA) were tested by Western blotting. DVL2 overexpressed lentivirus was transfected into the knee of CIA rats. Primary chondrocytes were extracted from RA patients by knee arthroplasty and transfected with DVL2 overexpressed lentivirus. Gene expression of related inflammation related cytokines was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . Results: Compared with knee articular cartilage in OA patients and normal rats, DVL2 protein was highly expressed in knee cartilage of RA patients and CIA rats (P values 0.041 and 0.032, respectively). DVL2 did not significantly affect the destruction of knee cartilage in CIA rats (P=0.885). DVL2 overexpression in chondrocytes enhanced gene expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP-3, and MMP-9, which could be more pronounced when tumor necrosis factor alpha was added. Conclusions: DVL2 is highly expressed in RA articular cartilage and promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines and MMP gene in chondrocytes by activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which involves in the destruction of articular cartilage in RA.
目的： 探讨巢乱蛋白2 (DVL2）在类风湿关节炎（RA）膝关节软骨中的表达及其对软骨破坏的影响。 方法： Western blot检测类风湿关节炎（RA）和骨关节炎（OA）患者及胶原诱导关节炎（CIA）大鼠和健康大鼠膝关节软骨中DVL2蛋白表达。将DVL2过表达慢病毒转染入CIA大鼠膝关节后，观察其对CIA大鼠关节软骨的影响；将DVL2过表达慢病毒转染入RA患者膝关节软骨细胞后，实时定量-聚合酶链式反应（RT-PCR）检测软骨细胞中细胞因子基因的表达。 结果： RA患者膝关节软骨组织中DVL2蛋白表达高于OA患者（2.04±0.76比0.97±0.37，t=2.815, P=0.044）。CIA大鼠膝关节软骨中DVL2蛋白表达高于健康大鼠（2.18±0.68比0.92±0.05，t=2.921, P=0.042）。转染DVL2过表达慢病毒后对CIA大鼠膝关节软骨的破坏无显著影响（P=0.885）。转染DVL2过表达慢病毒后，可上调RA患者膝关节软骨细胞中环氧合酶2（COX-2）、诱导型一氧化氮合酶（iNOS）、基质金属蛋白酶（MMP）-2、MMP-3、MMP-9mRNA表达，当加入肿瘤坏死因子α（TNFα）刺激后，COX-2、iNOS、MMP-2、MMP-3、MMP-9mRNA表达更为明显。 结论： DVL2在RA患者关节软骨中处于高表达，并通过激活Wnt/β-catenin通路促进软骨细胞破坏相关基因表达，从而参与RA关节软骨的破坏。.
Orexins are peptides found in the hypothalamus and other peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, the endocrine cells of the gut, adrenal gland testis, and the pancreas. They play important roles in neuro-protection by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory response via their type 1 and 2 receptors (OX1R and OX2R). The expressions of OX1R and OX2R were detected and the physiological function of orexin A in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) was investigated in this study. Only OX1R was found on FLSs and the expression of OX1R was decreased in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-FLSs) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-treated FLSs. Orexin A exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect on TNF-α treated FLSs. Particularly, orexin A treatment reduced the secretions of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, we showed that orexin A ameliorated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Mechanistically, we found that orexin A inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The current study provides a basis for the potential application of orexin A in the clinical treatment of RA.
Adropin, a secreted protein, is encoded by the energy homeostasis-associated gene (ENHO). It is expressed by a variety of tissues and cells. It has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as angiogenesis and apoptosis.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the ENHO gene expression and serum adropin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
The study included 36 patients with RA, 22 patients with SLE and 20 healthy controls (HC). Patients with a disease activity score-28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) &gt;2.6 in the RA group and an SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) &gt;6 in the SLE group were accepted as active. Serum adropin levels were analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The ENHO gene and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The ENHO gene mRNA expression was significantly higher in the RA group than in the HC group (p = 0.024), although it was similar between the SLE and HC groups (p = 0.920). On the other hand, there were no significant differences among the study groups in terms of serum adropin levels (p &gt; 0.05 for all). Moreover, there was no significant difference in terms of the ENHO expression and serum adropin levels between active and inactive RA and SLE patients.
Although the ENHO gene expression is increased, serum adropin level is not altered in RA. Similarly, adropin seems not to be associated with SLE. However, the potential link between adropin and inflammatory diseases need to be tested by further studies.
Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Stachydrine (STA) is an active component in Chinese motherwort Leonurus heterophyllus sweet, which has been widely used for gynecological and cardiovascular disorders. This study is aimed to examine the effects of STA on homocysteine (Hcy)-induced endothelial dysfunction.
The effects of STA on vascular relaxation in rat thoracic aortas (TA), mesenteric arteries (MA) and renal arteries (RA) were measured by using Multi Myograph System. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and guanosine 3', 5' cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) were determined. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dimers and monomers were assayed by using Western blotting. GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expressions were measured by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting.
STA effectively blocked Hcy-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in rat TA, MA and RA. STA-elicited arterial relaxations were reduced by NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H- [1, 2, 4] Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but not by inducible iNOS inhibitor 1400 W nor the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin. Hcy caused eNOS uncoupling and decreases in NO, cGMP and BH4, which were attenuated by STA. Moreover, STA prevented decreases of GTPCH1 and DHFR levels in Hcy-treated BAECs.
We demonstrated that STA effectively reversed the Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and prevented eNOS uncoupling by increasing the expression of GTPCH1 and DHFR. These results revealed a novel mechanism by which STA exerts its beneficial vascular effects.
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) act in various rheumatic diseases. Although NET formation was originally described as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)-dependent pathway, it appears that there are also NOX-independent pathways of NET release. Currently, no tools are available that can discriminate between both NET-forming pathways. We aimed to develop a serological method allowing the discrimination between NETs generated through NOX-dependent or NOX-independent pathways.
Histones from in vitro generated NOX-dependent and NOX-independent NETs were characterised with a panel of lupus-derived antibodies against N-terminal histone tails using immunofluorescence microscopy, western blot and ELISA. NETs in patients with NET-associated diseases, that is, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and sepsis, were characterised in sandwich ELISAs employing antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-terminal histone tails as detecting and capturing antibodies, respectively. Functional responses of endothelial cells to NOX-dependent and NOX-independent NETs were assessed as well.
Neutrophil elastase cleaves the N-terminal tails of core histones during NOX-dependent, but not during NOX-independent NET formation. Consequently, the detection of MPO-histone complexes with antibodies against N-terminal histone tails allows discrimination between NETs formed through a NOX-dependent or NOX-independent manner. Characterisation of in vivo circulating NETs revealed the presence of NOX-independent NETs in RA, SLE and sepsis, but NOX-dependent NETs in PsA. NOX-independent NETs displayed an increased capacity to activate endothelial cells when compared with NOX-dependent NETs.
These results indicate heterogeneity in NET-forming pathways in vivo and highlight the need for disease-specific strategies to prevent NET-mediated pathology.
The developing vertebrate embryo is exquisitely sensitive to retinoic acid (RA) concentration, particularly during anteroposterior patterning. In contrast to Nodal and Wnt signaling, RA was not previously considered to be an instructive signal in mesoderm formation during gastrulation. Here, we show in Xenopus that RARγ is indispensable for the expression of early mesoderm markers and is, therefore, an obligatory factor in mesodermal competence and/or maintenance. We identified several novel targets upregulated by RA receptor signaling in the early gastrula that are expressed in the circumblastoporal ring and linked to mesodermal development. Despite overlapping expression patterns of the genes encoding the RA-synthesizing enzyme Aldh1a2 and the RA-degrading enzyme Cyp26a1, RARγ1 functions as a transcriptional activator in early mesoderm development, suggesting that RA ligand is available to the embryo earlier than previously appreciated. RARγ1 is required for cellular adhesion, as revealed by spontaneous dissociation and depletion of ncam1 mRNA in animal caps harvested from RARγ1 knockdown embryos. RARγ1 knockdown obliterates somite boundaries, and causes loss of Myod protein in the presomitic mesoderm, but ectopic, persistent expression of Myod protein in the trunk. Thus, RARγ1 is required for stabilizing the mesodermal fate, myogenic commitment, somite boundary formation, and terminal skeletal muscle differentiation.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered to be a systemic autoimmune disease that induces systemic complications and progressive disability. It affects a large number of people. RA fibroblast‑like synoviocytes (RA‑FLS) promote the progression of RA through the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increasing invasiveness into the extracellular matrix. Therefore, targeting RA‑FLS represents a potential approach for the treatment of RA. Ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2), a critical protein for DNA synthesis and repair, may promote the proliferation of cells and inhibit cellular apoptosis. In previous studies it has been confirmed that the suppression of RRM2 markedly suppressed the proliferation of liver cancer cells. In the present study, a cell permeable peptide‑conjugated liposome‑polycation‑DNA (LPD) complex loaded with RRM2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (CCP‑LPDR) was developed, aiming to increase the levels of apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of RA‑FLS. CCP‑LPDR is a small‑sized molecule (~130 nm) with high encapsulation efficiency of siRNA (&gt;90%) and high stability. Furthermore, it was verified that CCP‑LPDR markedly suppressed RRM2 gene and protein expression by ~80%. Notably, CCP‑LPDR efficiently targeted RA‑FLS, resulting in a marked decrease in the proliferation and increase in the level of apoptosis in RA‑FLS. In addition, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6 were markedly decreased in RA‑FLS following CCP‑LPDR treatment. Therefore, CCP‑LPDR may efficiently deliver RRM2 to RA‑FLS and represent a potential treatment for RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) plays various embryogenesis and post-embryogenesis roles in vertebrates. As exposure of metamorphosing flounder larvae to RA has teratogenic effects on skin color and vertebral column development, harmonized RA synthesis and catabolism are likely essential in metamorphic development. To approach understanding of the roles of RA in flounder metamorphic development, we here examined the tissue mRNA expression of RA synthases (aldh1a1, aldh1a2, aldh1a3) and catabolic enzymes (cyp26a1, cyp26b1, cyp26c1) in newly hatched and metamorphosing larvae, and three-month-old juveniles by in situ hybridization (ISH). No ISH signal was detected for any genes from the skin and vertebral column susceptible to the teratogenic effects by RA. Since the intestine expressed aldh1a2 at high level in larvae but not in juvenile, it is a possibility that the larval intestine serves as a source of RA, and RA catabolic enzymes function at the level below sensitivity of ISH at vertebral column and skin development. We found that aldh1a2 and aldh1a3 were expressed along the margin of the tectum and the neurohypophysis of pituitary, respectively, both in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cyp26b1 at the posterior tectum and cerebellum. We hypothesize that RA is supplied from the tectum and pituitary via the CSF for brain growth and maintenance, and cyp26b1 locally regulates RA contents in the brain.
Periploca forrestii Schltr. (P. forrestii) is a species used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) known as "Miao medicine", and has a long history of use in the treatment of rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and joint pain. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-arthritis effects of the cardenolide-rich and caffeoylquinic acid-rich fractions (CDLFs and CQAFs) of P. forrestii in collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats, and defined the mechanisms of therapeutic action in MH7A cells treated with TNF-α. Serum rheumatoid factor (RF), TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE₂, NO, SOD, and MDA were determined by ELISA or other commercially assay kits. Histopathological changes in ankle joint tissues were examined. The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS in MH7A cells were measured by qRT-PCR assays. In addition, the expressions of iNOS, COX-2, and p65 proteins, and the phosphorylation of IκBα, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK proteins in MH7A cells were analyzed by Western blot. The results showed that CDLF and CQAF could suppress the paw swelling in CIA rats at different doses (125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg). Histopathological examination suggests that the CDLF and CQAF significantly relieved the damage of the structure of the ankle joint in CIA rats. In addition, serum RF, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE₂, NO, and MDA were decreased, along with increased activity of serum SOD. Furthermore, CDLF and CQAF downregulated the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, and p65, and inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK in MH7A cells treated with TNF-α. These findings demonstrated that both CDLF and CQAF exhibited anti-arthritic activity, which might be associated with their inhibitory effects on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.
Mammalian sex determination depends on a complex interplay of signals that promote the bipotential fetal gonad to develop as either a testis or an ovary, but the details are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether removal of the signaling molecule retinoic acid (RA) by the degradative enzyme CYP26B1 is necessary for proper development of somatic cells of the testes. Gonadal organ culture experiments suggested that RA promotes expression of some ovarian markers and suppresses expression of some testicular markers, acting downstream of Sox9. XY Cyp26b1-null embryos, in which endogenous RA is not degraded, develop mild ovotestes, but more important, steroidogenesis is impaired and the reproductive tract feminized. Experiments involving purified gonadal cells showed that these effects are independent of germ cells and suggest the direct involvement of the orphan nuclear receptor DAX1. Our results reveal that active removal of endogenous RA is required for normal testis development in the mouse.
Islet regeneration is stimulated after transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic progenitor cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-activity into NOD/SCID mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced β cell ablation. ALDHhi progenitor cells represent a rare subset within UCB that will require expansion without the loss of islet regenerative functions for use in cell therapies. ALDHhi cells efficiently expand (&gt;70-fold) under serum-free conditions; however, high ALDH-activity is rapidly diminished during culture coinciding with emergence of a committed megakaryocyte phenotype CD41+/CD42+/CD38+. ALDH-activity is also the rate-limiting step in retinoic acid (RA) production, a potent driver of hematopoietic differentiation. We have previously shown that inhibition of RA production during 9-day cultures, using diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) treatment, enhanced the expansion of ALDHhi cells (&gt;20-fold) with vascular regenerative paracrine functions. Herein, we sought to determine if DEAB-treatment also expanded ALDHhi cells that retain islet regenerative function following intrapancreatic transplantation into hyperglycemic mice. After DEAB-treatment, expanded ALDHhi cell subset was enriched for CD34+/CD38- expression and demonstrated enhanced myeloid multipotency in vitro compared to the ALDHlo cell subset. Unfortunately, DEAB-treated ALDHhi cells did not support islet regeneration after transplantation. Conversely, expanded ALDHlo cells from DEAB-treated conditions reduced hyperglycemia, and increased islet number and cell proliferation in STZ-induced hyperglycemic NOD/SCID mice. DEAB-treated ALDHlo cells were largely committed to a CD41+/CD42+ megakaryocyte phenotype. Collectively, this study provides preliminary evidence that committed cells of the megakaryocyte-lineage support endogenous islet regeneration and/or function, and the retention of high ALDH-activity did not coincide with islet regenerative function after expansion under serum-free culture conditions.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cellular infiltration into the joints and cartilage destruction. Neutrophils play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA. Triptolide (TP) is a bioactive compound derived from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, which has been used in folk medicine as a treatment for a variety of inflammatory disorders, including RA, for many centuries. Previous studies have shown that TP possesses anti-arthritic activity. However, the anti-arthritic mechanism of TP remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we used the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) murine model of RA to investigate the impact of TP on RA and neutrophil function. TP alleviated AA by reducing neutrophil recruitment and suppressing the expression of interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α in vivo. TP also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, promoted neutrophil apoptosis and inhibited the migration, NETosis and autophagy of neutrophils in vitro. Based on our findings, TP effectively ameliorates RA by down-regulating neutrophil inflammatory functions, indicating that TP represents a potential therapeutic agent for RA.
Transcriptional regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is critically involved in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the specific transcription factors that control this process remain largely unidentified. In the present study, it was discovered that expression of the key erythroid factor, globin transcription factor 1 (GATA1), is significantly greater in human RA synovial tissues than in osteoarthritis (OA) tissues. IL 6 was found to induce synovial GATA1 expression in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent manner. Functionally, knockdown of GATA1 expression using specific small interfering RNA treatment was found to compromise immunoreaction-elicited expression of proinflammatory cytokines and thus impair invasiveness of the human fibroblast-like synovial cell line MH7A, whereas introduction of exogenous GATA1 was found to promote production of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to greater aggressiveness of MH7A cells. Mechanistically, GATA1 acts as the transcriptional coactivator of NOS2 (the gene encoding iNOS) transcription. Collectively, these data suggest that synovial GATA1 is an essential contributor to development and exacerbation of RA, presumably by inducing NOS2 transcription.
Systemic inflammation has been linked to suppressed CYP3A4 activity. The aim of this study was to examine associations between levels of a broad selection of cytokines and CYP3A4 phenotype in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study included 31 RA patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors. CYP3A4 phenotype was measured as serum concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βOHC) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in samples collected prior to and 3 months after initiation of treatment with TNF-α inhibitors. Serum levels of the following 21 cytokines were determined in the same samples using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex technology): CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and TNF-α Correlations between levels of cytokines and 4βOHC were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation tests. Among the investigated cytokines, three were negatively correlated with CYP3A4 phenotype during treatment with TNF-α inhibitors: i.e., IL-1ra (r = -0.408, P = 0.023), IL-6 (r = -0.410, P = 0.022) and CXCL8 (r = -0.403, P = 0.025) (P ≥ 0.3 for all other cytokines). None of the analyzed cytokines were correlated with CYP3A4 phenotype prior to TNF-α inhibitor treatment (P &gt; 0.1 for all cytokines). These findings suggest that immune responses associated with increased levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, and CXCL8 may suppress CYP3A4 metabolism. Further studies are required to evaluate these preliminary findings in different patient populations and also examine the possible molecular mechanisms behind our observations.
In mammals, the epithelial tissues of major salivary glands generate saliva and drain it into the oral cavity. For submandibular salivary glands (SMGs), the epithelial tissues arise during embryogenesis from naïve oral ectoderm adjacent to the base of the tongue, which begins to thicken, express SOX9 and invaginate into underlying mesenchyme. The developmental mechanisms initiating salivary gland development remain unexplored. In this study, we show that retinoic acid (RA) signaling activity at the site of gland initiation is colocalized with expression of retinol metabolic genes Rdh10 and Aldh1a2 in the underlying SMG mesenchyme. Utilizing a novel ex vivo assay for SMG initiation developed for this study, we show that RDH10 and RA are required for salivary gland initiation. Moreover, we show that the requirement for RA in gland initiation involves canonical signaling through retinoic acid receptors (RAR). Finally, we show that RA signaling essential for gland initiation is transduced specifically through RARα, with no contribution from other RAR isoforms. This is the first study to identify a molecular signal regulating mammalian salivary gland initiation.
Outbreaks caused by asexual lineages of fungal and oomycete pathogens are a continuing threat to crops, wild animals and natural ecosystems (Fisher MC, Henk DA, Briggs CJ, Brownstein JS, Madoff LC, McCraw SL, Gurr SJ, Nature 484:186-194, 2012; Kupferschmidt K, Science 337:636-638, 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying genome evolution and phenotypic plasticity in asexual eukaryotic microbes remain poorly understood (Seidl MF, Thomma BP, BioEssays 36:335-345, 2014). Ever since the 19th century Irish famine, the oomycete Phytophthora infestans has caused recurrent outbreaks on potato and tomato crops that have been primarily caused by the successive rise and migration of pandemic asexual lineages (Goodwin SB, Cohen BA, Fry WE, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:11591-11595, 1994; Yoshida K, Burbano HA, Krause J, Thines M, Weigel D, Kamoun S, PLoS Pathog 10:e1004028, 2014; Yoshida K, Schuenemann VJ, Cano LM, Pais M, Mishra B, Sharma R, Lanz C, Martin FN, Kamoun S, Krause J, et al. eLife 2:e00731, 2013; Cooke DEL, Cano LM, Raffaele S, Bain RA, Cooke LR, Etherington GJ, Deahl KL, Farrer RA, Gilroy EM, Goss EM, et al. PLoS Pathog 8:e1002940, 2012). However, the dynamics of genome evolution within these clonal lineages have not been determined. The objective of this study was to use a comparative genomics and transcriptomics approach to determine the molecular mechanisms that underpin phenotypic variation within a clonal lineage of P. infestans.
Here, we reveal patterns of genomic and gene expression variation within a P. infestans asexual lineage by comparing strains belonging to the South American EC-1 clone that has dominated Andean populations since the 1990s (Yoshida K, Burbano HA, Krause J, Thines M, Weigel D, Kamoun S, PLoS Pathog 10e1004028, 2014; Yoshida K, Schuenemann VJ, Cano LM, Pais M, Mishra B, Sharma R, Lanz C, Martin FN, Kamoun S, Krause J, et al. eLife 2:e00731, 2013; Delgado RA, Monteros-Altamirano AR, Li Y, Visser RGF, van der Lee TAJ, Vosman B, Plant Pathol 62:1081-1088, 2013; Forbes GA, Escobar XC, Ayala CC, Revelo J, Ordonez ME, Fry BA, Doucett K, Fry WE, Phytopathology 87:375-380, 1997; Oyarzun PJ, Pozo A, Ordonez ME, Doucett K, Forbes GA, Phytopathology 88:265-271, 1998). We detected numerous examples of structural variation, nucleotide polymorphisms and loss of heterozygosity within the EC-1 clone. Remarkably, 17 genes are not expressed in one of the two EC-1 isolates despite apparent absence of sequence polymorphisms. Among these, silencing of an effector gene was associated with evasion of disease resistance conferred by a potato immune receptor.
Our findings highlight the molecular changes underpinning the exceptional genetic and phenotypic plasticity associated with host adaptation in a pandemic clonal lineage of a eukaryotic plant pathogen. We observed that the asexual P. infestans lineage EC-1 can exhibit phenotypic plasticity in the absence of apparent genetic mutations resulting in virulence on a potato carrying the Rpi-vnt1.1 gene. Such variant alleles may be epialleles that arose through epigenetic changes in the underlying genes.
This study revealed multifaceted regulation of ALDH1A1 by Cdk5 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. ALDH1A1 is a multifunctional enzyme with dehydrogenase, esterase, and anti-oxidant activities. ALDH1A1 is also a major regulator of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, which is critical for normal brain homeostasis. We identified ALDH1A1 as both physiological and pathological target of Cdk5. First, under neurotoxic conditions, Cdk5-induced oxidative stress upregulates ALDH1A1 transcription. Second, Cdk5 increases ALDH1A1 levels by preventing its ubiquitylation via direct phosphorylation. Third, ALDH1A1 phosphorylation increases its dehydrogenase activity by altering its tetrameric state to a highly active monomeric state. Fourth, persistent oxidative stress triggered by deregulated Cdk5 inactivates ALDH1A1. Thus, initially, the good Cdk5 attempts to mitigate ensuing oxidative stress by upregulating ALDH1A1 via phosphorylation and paradoxically by increasing oxidative stress. Later, sustained oxidative stress generated by Cdk5 inhibits ALDH1A1 activity, leading to neurotoxicity. ALDH1A1 upregulation is highly neuroprotective. In human AD tissues, ALDH1A1 levels increase with disease severity. However, ALDH1A1 activity was highest at mild and moderate stages, but declines significantly at severe stage. These findings confirm that during the initial stages, neurons attempt to upregulate and activate ALDH1A1 to protect from accruing oxidative stress-induced damage; however, persistently deleterious conditions inactivate ALDH1A1, further contributing to neurotoxicity. This study thus revealed two faces of Cdk5, good and bad in neuronal function and survival, with a single substrate, ALDH1A1. The bad Cdk5 prevails in the end, overriding the good Cdk5 act, suggesting that Cdk5 is an effective therapeutic target for AD.
Dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) on immune cells is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mast cells (MCs) are currently identified as important effector cells in synovial inflammation of RA, but little is known about the role of D3R on synovial MCs in the pathogenesis of RA. Several inflammatory cells in the synovium induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation which are involved in the progression of RA. However, it is unclear whether D3R on synovial MCs is related to the levels of ROS in RA patients. In this study, a total of 73 patients with RA were divided into three groups according to disease activity DAS28 scores. The number of cases in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 19, 26, and 28, respectively. We examined D3R-positive MC numbers in the synovial fluid and ROS levels in each group of RA patients, and we also analyzed the association of D3R-positive MC numbers with RA disease activity and ROS levels. MDA and protein carbonylation in the serum and synovial fluid were measured to reflect the level of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, respectively. Additionally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the serum and synovial fluid were used to be markers of antioxidant levels. Our results showed that D3R-positive MCs in the synovial fluid showed a declining trend with the increased disease activity DAS28 score in RA patients. There was negative correlation between D3R-positive MC numbers in the synovial fluid and disease severity DAS28 score of RA patients. Moreover, D3R-positive MC numbers in the synovial fluid were negatively correlated with the level of MDA and protein carbonylation while were positively correlated with antioxidant levels such as SOD and CAT in RA patients. Our results suggested that D3R on MCs may be involved in ROS-mediated pathogenesis of RA.
The radiation of symbiotic copepods (Crustacea: Copepoda) living in association with stony corals (Cnidaria: Scleractinia) is considered host-specific and linked to the phylogenetic diversification of their hosts. However, symbiotic copepods are poorly investigated, occurrence records are mostly anecdotal, and no explicit analysis exists regarding their relationship with the hosts. Here, we analysed the occurrence of symbiotic copepods on different co-occurring and phylogenetically closely related scleractinian corals. We used an innovative approach of DNA extraction from single microscopic specimens that preserves the shape of the organisms for integrative morphological studies. The rationale of the study involved: (i) sampling of mushroom corals (Fungiidae) belonging to 13 species and eight genera on different reefs along the Saudi coastline in the Red Sea, (ii) extraction of all the associated copepods, (iii) morphological screening and identification of copepod species, (iv) use of DNA taxonomy on mitochondrial and nuclear markers to determine species boundaries for morphologically unknown copepod species, (v) reconstruction of phylogenies to understand their evolutionary relationships, and (vi) analysis of the ecological drivers of the occurrence, diversity and host specificity of the copepods. The seven species of coral-associated copepods, all new to science, did not show any statistically significant evidence of host-specificity or other pattern of ecological association. We thus suggest that, contrary to most assumptions and previous anecdotal evidence on this coral-copepod host-symbiont system, the association between copepods and their host corals is rather labile, not strict, and not phylogenetically constrained, changing our perception on evolutionary patterns and processes in symbiotic copepods.
Spermatogenesis in mammals is a very complex, highly organized process, regulated in part by testosterone and retinoic acid (RA). Much is known about how RA and testosterone signaling pathways independently regulate this process, but there is almost no information regarding whether these two signaling pathways directly interact and whether RA is crucial for steroidogenic cell function. This study uses a transgenic mouse line that expresses a dominant-negative form of RA receptor α (RAR-DN) and the steroidogenic cell-specific Cre mouse line, Cyp17iCre, to generate male mice with steroidogenic cells unable to perform RA signaling. Testes of mutant mice displayed increased apoptosis of pachytene spermatocytes, an increased number of macrophages in the interstitium and a loss of advanced germ cells. Additionally, blocking RA signaling in Leydig cells resulted in increased permeability of the blood-testis barrier, decreased levels of the steroidogenic enzyme cytochrome P450 17a1 and decreased testosterone levels. Surprisingly, the epididymides of the mutant mice also displayed an abnormal phenotype. This study demonstrates that RA signaling is required in steroidogenic cells for their normal function and, thus, for male fertility.
The predominant function of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is to maintain retinal homeostasis by regulating the influx and efflux between the blood and retina. Breakdown of the BRB occurs in a number of ocular diseases that result in vision loss. Understanding the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the development and maintenance of the BRB is critical to developing therapeutics for these conditions. To visualize the BRB in vivo, we used the transgenic Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish model that expresses vitamin D binding protein (a member of the albumin gene family) tagged to green fluorescent protein. Retinoic acid (RA) plays a number of important roles in vertebrate development and has been shown to play a protective role during inflammation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. The role of RA in BRB development and maintenance remains unknown. To disrupt RA signaling, Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish were treated with N, N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde and 4-[(1 E)-2-[5,6-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-8-(2-phenylethynyl)-2-naphthalenyl]ethenyl]benzoic acid, which are antagonists of retinal dehydrogenase and the RA receptor, respectively. Treatment with either compound resulted in BRB disruption and reduced visual acuity, whereas cotreatment with all- trans RA effectively rescued BRB integrity. Additionally, transgenic overexpression of Cyp26a1, which catalyzes RA degradation, resulted in breakdown of the BRB. Our results demonstrate that RA signaling is critical for maintenance of the BRB and could play a role in diseases such as diabetic macular edema.-Pollock, L. M., Xie, J., Bell, B. A., Anand-Apte, B. Retinoic acid signaling is essential for maintenance of the blood-retinal barrier.
Dental resin curing blue light (BL) is frequently used during treatments in dental clinics. However, little is known about the influence of BL irradiation on pulpal blood vessels. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of effect of BL irradiation on vascular tone. Rat aorta (RA) rings were irradiated with a BL source in organ baths, and the responses were recorded isometrically. Effect of BL irradiation on phenylephrine (PE) -precontraction and acetylcholine (ACh) -induced relaxation after PE -precontraction were obtained and compared in BL -irradiated and control RA rings. Effect of 20 min preincubation with catalase (enzyme that breaks down hydrogene peroxide, 1200 u/ml) on PE -precontraced and BL-irradiated rings was also evaluated. Total oxidative stress (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in BL-irradiated and control RA preparations were measured with special assay kits and spectrophotometry. BL slightly decreased ACh -induced endothelium -dependent relaxations in PE (1 μM) -precontracted RA rings (n = 6, p &gt; 0.05 vs. control). BL induced marked contraction 23.88 + 3.10% of PE (maximum contraction) in isolated RA ring segments precontracted with PE (p &lt; 0.05 vs. control). The contractile effect of BL was inhibited by 1200 u/ml catalase (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05 vs. control). BL irradiation increased the level of TOS in RA rings (n = 6, p &lt; 0.05 vs. control). TAC levels were similar in BL-irradiated and control preparations. These results suggest that BL induces contraction in RA, and the mechanism of this effect may to be through release of hydrogen peroxide.
This study is the first to explore the influence of incident light intensity on the photosynthetic responses under mixotrophic growth of microalga Asteracys sp. When grown mixotrophically, there was an enhanced regulation of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the excited state of chlorophyll (Chl) a within the cells in response to white cool fluorescent high light (HL; 600 µmol photons m-2 s-1). Simultaneous measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as malondialdehyde (MDA) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), an ROS scavenger, showed improved management of stress within mixotrophic cells under HL. Despite the observed decrease in quantum yield of photosynthesis measured through the Chl a fluorescence transient, no reduction in biomass accumulation was observed under HL for mixotrophy. However, biomass loss owing to photoinhibition was observed in cells grown phototrophically under the same irradiance. The measurements of dark recovery of NPQ suggested that "state transitions" may be partly responsible for regulating overall photosynthesis in Asteracys sp. The partitioning of photochemical and non-photochemical processes to sustain HL stress was analysed. Collectively, this study proposes that mixotrophy using glucose leads to a change in the photosynthetic abilities of Asteracys sp. while enhancing the adaptability of the alga to high irradiances.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder linked to oxidative stress of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). The effects and potential mechanism of salicin on inflammation and oxidative stress of RA-FLSs were examined by MTT, ELISA, and Western blot methods. Salicin significantly reduced cell viability (82.03 ± 7.06, P &lt; 0.01), cytokines (47.70 ± 1.48 ng/L for TNF-α, 30.03 ± 3.49 ng/L for IL-6) ( P &lt; 0.01), and matrix metalloproteinases-1/-3 expression ( P &lt; 0.01) in IL-1β-induced RA-FLSs and inhibited ROS generation and p65 phosphorylation ( P &lt; 0.01) as compared with IL-1β-induced treatment. Moreover, salicin promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation (2.15 ± 0.21) and HO-1 expression (1.12 ± 0.05) and reduced ROS production in IL-1β-induced RA-FLSs ( P &lt; 0.01). Salicin not only reduced the collagen-induced arthritis by reducing the clinical score ( P &lt; 0.01), inflammatory infiltration, and synovial hyperplasia in vivo but also suppressed the oxidative damage indexes (SOD 155.40 ± 6.53 U/mg tissue, MDA 152.80 ± 5.89 nmol/g tissue, GSH 50.98 ± 3.45 nmol/g tissue, and CAT 0.92 ± 0.10 U/g protein) ( P &lt; 0.01) of ankle joint cells. Conclusively, our findings indicate that salicin ameliorates rheumatoid arthritis, which may be associated with oxidative stress and Nrf2-HO-1-ROS pathways in RA-FLSs.
Cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, is an important endogenous regulator of inflammation. Jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3) is implicated in the immune response and inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential contribution of JMJD3 to endogenous CSE-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upregulated CSE and JMJD3 were identified in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) from RA patients as well as in the joints of arthritic mice. Knocking down CSE augmented inflammation in IL-1β-induced SFs by increasing JMJD3 expression. In addition, CSE-/- mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) developed severe joint inflammation and bone erosion. Conversely, overexpressing CSE inhibited JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 and was accompanied by reduced inflammation in IL-1β-treated SFs. Furthermore, JMJD3 silencing or the administration of the JMJD3 inhibitor GSK-J4 significantly decreased the inflammatory response in IL-1β-treated SFs, mainly by controlling the methylation status of H3K27me3 at the promoter of its target genes. GSK-J4 markedly attenuated the severity of arthritis in CIA mice. In conclusion, suppressing JMJD3 expression by the transcription factor Sp-1 is likely responsible for the ability of CSE to negatively modulate the inflammatory response and reduce the progression of RA.
The study investigated the association between plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 with 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C), thymidylate synthase (TYMS 2R → 3R) and methionine synthase (MTR A2756G) polymorphisms and methotrexate (MTX) treatment and toxicity in Tunisian Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
A total of 185 patients with RA were included. Homocysteine (Hcy) was assessed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and folate and vitamin B12 were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassays. The genetic polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR or PCR-RFLP. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) was considered for Hcy &gt; 15 µmol/L.
MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with HHC in RA patients (multi-adjusted OR, 95% CI 2.18, [1.07-4.57]; p = 0.031). No association was detected with the remaining polymorphisms. Plasma Hcy, folate, and vitamin B12 did not differ according to each polymorphism, or with MTX treatment or toxicity. However, HHC was more prevalent in patients with than those without MTX toxicity (32.7 vs. 16.7%; p = 0.035).
The MTHFR 677TT genotype is an independent risk factor for HHC in Tunisians RA patients. HHC could be a useful marker of MTX toxicity in RA patients.
Over the last decades, the silent-killer carbon monoxide (CO) has been shown to also be an endogenous cytoprotective molecule able to inhibit cell death and modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Neuronal metabolism is mostly oxidative and neurons also use glucose for maintaining their anti-oxidant status by generation of reduced glutathione (GSH) via the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP). It is established that neuronal differentiation depends on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and signalling, however there is a lack of information about modulation of the PPP during adult neurogenesis. Thus, the main goal of this study was to unravel the role of CO on cell metabolism during neuronal differentiation, particularly by targeting PPP flux and GSH levels as anti-oxidant system. A human neuroblastoma SH-S5Y5 cell line was used, which differentiates into post-mitotic neurons by treatment with retinoic acid (RA), supplemented or not with CO-releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1). SH-SY5Y cell differentiation supplemented with CORM-A1 prompted an increase in neuronal yield production. It did, however, not alter glycolytic metabolism, but increased the PPP. In fact, CORM-A1 treatment stimulated (i) mRNA expression of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH) and transketolase (TKT), which are enzymes for oxidative and non-oxidative phases of the PPP, respectively and (ii) protein expression and activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Likewise, whenever G6PD was knocked-down CO-induced improvement on neuronal differentiation was reverted, while pharmacological inhibition of GSH synthesis did not change CO's effect on the improvement of neuronal differentiation. Both results indicate the key role of PPP in CO-modulation of neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, at the end of SH-SY5Y neuronal differentiation process, CORM-A1 supplementation increased the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) without alteration of GSH metabolism. These data corroborate with PPP stimulation. In conclusion, CO improves neuronal differentiation of SH-S5Y5 cells by stimulating the PPP and modulating the GSH system.
Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is essential for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and vertebrate development. RA biosynthesis and metabolism are controlled by a series of enzymes, but the molecular regulators of these enzymes remain largely obscure. In this study, we investigated the functional role of the WD-domain protein STRAP (serine threonine kinase receptor-associated protein) in the pluripotency and lineage commitment of murine ESCs. We generated Strap knockout (KO) mouse ESCs and subjected them to spontaneous differentiation. We observed that, despite the unchanged characteristics of ESCs, Strap KO ESCs exhibited defects for lineage differentiation. Signature gene expression analyses revealed that Strap deletion attenuated intracellular RA signaling in embryoid bodies (EBs), and exogenous RA significantly rescued this deficiency. Moreover, loss of Strap selectively induced Cyp26A1 expression in mouse EBs, suggesting a potential role of STRAP in RA signaling. Mechanistically, we identified putative Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) binding motifs to be critical in the enhancement of non-canonical RA-induced transactivation of Cyp26A1. Increased KLF9 expression in the absence of STRAP is partially responsible for Cyp26A1 induction. Interestingly, STRAP knockdown in Xenopus embryos influenced anterior-posterior neural patterning and impaired the body axis and eye development during early Xenopus embryogenesis. Taken together, our study reveals an intrinsic role for STRAP in the regulation of RA signaling and provides new molecular insights for ESC fate determination. Stem Cells 2018;36:1368-1379.
High-risk neuroblastoma is often distinguished by amplification of MYCN and loss of differentiation potential. We performed high-throughput drug screening of epigenetic-targeted therapies across a large and diverse tumor cell line panel and uncovered the hypersensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to GSK-J4, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) demethylases ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome (UTX), and histone demethylase Jumonji D3 (JMJD3). Mechanistically, GSK-J4 induced neuroblastoma differentiation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with accompanying up-regulation of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and induction of cell death. Retinoic acid (RA)-resistant neuroblastoma cells were sensitive to GSK-J4. In addition, GSK-J4 was effective at blocking the growth of chemorefractory and patient-derived xenograft models of high-risk neuroblastoma in vivo. Furthermore, GSK-J4 and RA combination increased differentiation and ER stress over GSK-J4 effects and limited the growth of neuroblastomas resistant to either drug alone. In MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, PUMA induction by GSK-J4 sensitized tumors to the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax, demonstrating that epigenetic-targeted therapies and BCL-2 homology domain 3 mimetics can be rationally combined to treat this high-risk subset of neuroblastoma. Therefore, H3K27 demethylation inhibition is a promising therapeutic target to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, and H3K27 demethylation can be part of rational combination therapies to induce robust antineuroblastoma activity.
Currently, biological and organic substances are screened in order to find a new generation of therapeutics active against cancer. Previous research has identified promising candidate peptides in snake venom. In this study, venoms from different snake species (Naja annulifera, Naja kaouthia, Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus) were screened for potential anti-cancer properties using pancreatic tumour cells as the assay system. The cells were incubated with venom and then subjected to the following analyses: (i) in vitro cell death (ii) in vitro migration (iii) in vivo dissemination and (iv) in vivo angiogenesis. For the in vivo assays, the cells, after incubation and labelling, were transplanted into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos for motility and angiogenesis. The results showed strong effects in cells treated with venoms from Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus in the in vitro assays. In the in vivo assays, venom derived from Ophiophagus hannah had the most potent effects with respect to angiogenesis. These venoms might therefore be considered as candidates for further studies.
About 70 genetic studies have already addressed the need of biomarkers to predict the response of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to methotrexate (MTX) treatment. However, no genetic biomarker has yet been sufficiently validated. Here, we aimed to replicate a selection of 25 SNPs in the largest collection of patients up to date, which consisted of 915 patients treated with MTX. The change in disease activity (measured as ΔDAS28) from baseline was considered the primary outcome. In addition, response according to widely used criteria (EULAR) was taken as secondary outcome. We considered consistency between outcomes, P values accounting for the number of SNPs, and independence from potential confounders for interpretation of the results. Only the rs1801394 SNP in MTRR fulfilled the high association standards. Its minor allele was associated with less improvement than the major allele according to ΔDAS28 (p = 0.0016), and EULAR response (p = 0.004), with independence of sex, age, baseline DAS28, smoking, seropositivity, concomitant corticosteroid use or previous treatments. In addition, previous evidence suggests the association of this SNP with response to MTX in another autoimmune disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and with high intracellular folate levels, which could contribute to poor response.
The effect of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the production of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants and hairy roots is receiving much attention. The roots and rhizomes of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge are widely used for treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The main components are liposoluble tanshinones and hydrophilic phenolic acids. Moreover, hairy root culture of S. miltiorrhiza has been used in research of valuable plant-derived secondary metabolites. In this study, we examined the effect of LEDs with different combinations of wavelengths on the content of the main components in hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza. Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) content in hairy roots was significantly decreased with all light treatments containing blue light by &gt;60% and was 9 times lower with LED treatment duration changed from 1 week to 3 weeks. HMGR, DXS2, DXR, GGPPS, CPS and CYP76AH1 genes involved in the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway were downregulated by blue light. Furthermore, light quality treatments have different effect on the accumulation of phenolic acids in hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza. The light treatments 6R3B, 6B3IR, 7RGB and 2R6BUV for 3 weeks could increase rosmarinic acid (RA) content slightly but not salvianolic acid B (SAB) content. Different secondary metabolite contents could be regulated by different wavelength combinations of LEDs. Blue light could reduce TSIIA content in hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza via gene regulation.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of black rice anthocyanin-rich extract (BRAE) and rosmarinic acid (RA), alone and in combination, on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Results showed that administration of BRAE and RA, alone and in combination, significantly decreased the disease activity index (DAI) and the histological score of colons in DSS-induced colitis mice. Moreover, the administration of BRAE and RA, alone and in combination, not only reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, but also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Our results showed that BRAE decreased the histological score and TNF-α mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, while BRAE + RA dose-dependently attenuated the histological score and mRNA expression of IL-6. However, the benefits of RA were not dose-dependent within the dose range of 25-100 mg kg-1. The combination of BRAE and RA showed better inhibitory effect on the NO content and iNOS mRNA expression than BRAE or RA given alone, and was the most effective in ameliorating DSS-induced colitis at 100 mg kg-1. Notably, the BRAE and RA combination exhibited additive interactions in reducing MPO and NO levels, as well as the expression of some pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1β and iNOS), especially at 100 mg kg-1. In conclusion, dietary BRAE and RA, alone and in combination, alleviate the symptoms and inflammation of DSS-induced colitis in mice, and may provide a promising dietary approach for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
Numerous studies have suggested that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important mediators of inflammatory response in human and animal models of arthritis. Besides, oxidative stress markers, nitric oxide (NO) and peroxide (PO) are also major contributors in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Over expression of these inflammatory mediators leads to the extracellular matrix degradation, and excessive cartilage and bone resorption, ultimately leading to the irreversible damage to joints. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-arthritic mechanism of bioflavonoids, rutin and rutin-conjugated gold nanoparticles (R-AuNPs) by determining their role in the modulation of NF-κB and iNOS expression in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of rats. Arthritis was induced by the subcutaneous administration of bovine type II collagen. Treatment was started with rutin, indomethacin + rutin (I + R) and R-AuNPs on the day of CIA induction. The severity of arthritis was determined by measuring the arthritic score on alternate days until mean arthritic score of 4 was observed. The NO and PO levels were also analyzed in serum samples. NF-κB and iNOS expression levels were determined in spleen tissue samples by real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Marked reduction in the arthritic score as well as in the NO and PO levels was observed in the treated groups. A significant downregulation in the NF-κB and iNOS expression levels was also observed in the treatment groups compared to the arthritic control group. Collectively, the findings suggest potential clinical role of rutin and R-AuNPs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Intermittent hypoxia (IH) has been shown to exert preconditioning-like cardioprotective effects. It also has been reported that IH preserves intracellular pH (pHi) during ischemia and protects cardiomyocytes against ischemic reperfusion injury. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear.
In this study, we used proton indicator BCECF-AM to analyze the rate of pHi recovery from acidosis in the IH model of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were first treated with repetitive hypoxia-normoxia cycles for 1-4 days. Cells were then acid loaded with NH4Cl, and the rate of pHi recovery from acidosis was measured.
We found that the pHi recovery rate from acidosis was much slower in the IH group than in the room air (RA) group. When we treated cardiomyocytes with Na+-H+ exchange (NHE) inhibitors (Amiloride and HOE642) or Na+-free Tyrode solution during the recovery, there was no difference between RA and IH groups. We also found intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) significantly increased after IH exposure for 4 days. However, the phenomenon could be abolished by pretreatment with ROS inhibitors (SOD and phenanathroline), intracellular calcium chelator or Na+-Ca2+ exchange (NCX) inhibitor. Furthermore, the pHi recovery rate from acidosis became faster in the IH group than in the RA group when inhibition of NCX activity.
These results suggest that IH would induce the elevation of ROS production. ROS then activates Ca2+-efflux mode of NCX and results in intracellular Na+ accumulation. The rise of [Na+]i further inhibits the activity of NHE-mediated acid extrusion and retards the rate of pHi recovery from acidosis during IH.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease. In this research, we estimated the protective effects of Dihydromyricetin (DMY) on RA induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). We found that DMY effectively relieved rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, such as body weight change, paw swelling and rheumatoid arthritis scores. In addition, we also observed that DMY significantly lowered the immune organ indexes (including thymus and spleen) and exhibited the anti-inflammatory effect in CFA-induced rheumatoid arthritis. The results demonstrated that the increased expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were significantly inhibited by DMY. Furthermore, the key inflammatory mediator, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was markedly lowered after treatment with DMY. A mechanistic study indicated that DMY could up-regulate the down-regulation levels of the mRNA and protein of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1. Moreover, the Nrf2 activation of DMY was abolished by Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol. Thus, DMY inhibits the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activating Nrf2 pathway in RA model, which suggests that DMY has potential for further investigation as a candidate anti-arthritic agent in future.
Zebrafish mutants with increased retinoic acid (RA) signaling due to the loss of the RA-inactivating enzyme Cyp26b1 develop a hyper-mineralized spine with gradually fusing vertebral body precursors (centra). However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that cells of the notochord epithelium named chordoblasts are sensitive to RA signaling. Chordoblasts are uniformly distributed along the anteroposterior axis and initially generate the continuous collagenous notochord sheath. However, subsequently and iteratively, subsets of these cells undergo further RA-dependent differentiation steps, acquire a stellate-like shape, downregulate expression of the collagen gene col2a1a, switch on cyp26b1 expression and trigger metameric sheath mineralization. This mineralization fails to appear upon chordoblast-specific cell ablation or RA signal transduction blockade. Together, our data reveal that, despite their different developmental origins, the activities and regulation of chordoblasts are very similar to those of osteoblasts, including their RA-induced transition from osteoid-producing cells to osteoid-mineralizing ones. Furthermore, our data point to a requirement for locally controlled RA activity within the chordoblast layer in order to generate the segmented vertebral column.
Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of the present study was to verify the influence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs on nitrosative and oxidative biomarkers in patients with RA. A total of 177 patients with RA and 150 healthy volunteers participated in this study, which measured lipid hydroperoxides, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), carbonyl protein, total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), uric acid (UA), and C-reactive protein (CRP). NOx and the NOx/TRAP ratio were significantly increased in RA, while no significant differences in lipid hydroperoxides, AOPP, UA, and TRAP levels were found between both groups. Treatment with leflunomide was associated with increased levels of carbonyl protein, and lowered levels in TRAP and UA, while the NOx/TRAP ratio further increased. NOx and the NOx/TRAP ratio were significantly higher in women than in men, while TRAP and UA were significantly lower in women. MetS was accompanied by increased AOPP and UA levels. RA was best predicted by increased NOx/TRAP ratio, CRP, and BMI. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that NOx and NOx/TRAP are strongly associated with RA physiopathology. Our findings suggest that inhibition of iNOS may become an interesting therapeutic approach for the treatment of RA. In addition, the presence of MetS and a decrease in levels of UA by leflunomide favor redox imbalance in RA patients. More studies are needed to evaluate the impact of antioxidant capacity reduction on RA progression.
Decoctions of Plectranthus species are traditionally ingested after large meals for treatment of food digestion and alcohol abuse.
This study aims at associating the digestion-related ethno-uses of Plectranthus species decoctions to molecular mechanism that might explain them: easing digestion (AChE inhibition) and treating hangover (ADH inhibition) MATERIAL AND METHODS: Decoctions from Plectranthus species were analysed for their alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibition and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, related with alcohol metabolism and intestinal motility, respectively. Identification of the active components was carried out by LC-MS/MS and the docking studies were performed with AChE and the bioactive molecules detected.
All decoctions inhibited ADH activity. This inhibition was correlated with their rosmarinic acid (RA) content, which showed an IC50 value of 19 μg/mL, similar to the reference inhibitor CuCl2. The presence of RA also leads to most decoctions showing AChE inhibiting capacity. P. zuluensis decoction with an IC50 of 80 μg/mL presented also medioresinol, an even better inhibitor of AChE, as indicated by molecular docking studies. Furthermore, all decoctions tested showed no toxicity towards two human cell lines, and a high capacity to quench free radicals (DPPH), which also play a helpful in the digestive process, related with their RA content.
All activities presented by the RA-rich Plectranthus decoctions support their use in treating digestion disorders and P. barbatus could explain its use also for alleviating hangover symptoms. Medioresinol, which is present in P. zuluensis, exhibited a significant AChE inhibition and may provide, in the future, a new lead for bioactive compounds.
VEGF secreted from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is responsible for the choroidal vascular development; however, the molecular regulatory mechanism is unclear. We found that Aldh1a1-/- mice showed choroidal hypoplasia with insufficient vascularization in the dorsal region, although Aldh1a1, an enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acids (RAs), is expressed in the dorsal neural retina, not in the RPE/choroid complex. The level of VEGF in the RPE/choroid was significantly decreased in Aldh1a1-/- mice, and RA-dependent enhancement of VEGF was observed in primary RPE cells. An RA-deficient diet resulted in dorsal choroidal hypoplasia, and simple RA treatment of Aldh1a1-/- pregnant females suppressed choroid hypoplasia in their offspring. We also found downregulation of Sox9 in the dorsal neural retina and RPE of Aldh1a1-/- mice and RPE-specific disruption of Sox9 phenocopied Aldh1a1-/- choroidal development. These results suggest that RAs produced by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina directs dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 upregulation in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion.
Rumex acetosa L. (Polygonaceae) is well known in traditional medicine for its therapeutic efficacy as an antihypertensive.
The study investigates antihypertensive potential of crude methanol extract (Ra.Cr) and fractions of Rumex acetosa in normotensive and hypertensive rat models and probes the underlying vascular mechanisms.
Ra.Cr and its fractions were tested in vivo on normotensive and hypertensive Sprague-Dawley rats under anaesthesia for blood pressure lowering effect. In vitro experiments on rat and Oryctolagus cuniculus rabbit aortae were employed to probe the underlying vasorelaxant mechanism.
In normotensive rats under anaesthesia, Ra.Cr caused fall in MAP (40 mmHg) at 50 mg/kg with % fall of 27.88 ± 4.55. Among the fractions tested, aqueous fraction was more potent at the dose of 50 mg/kg with % fall of 45.63 ± 2.84. In hypertensive rats under similar conditions, extract and fractions showed antihypertensive effect at same doses while aqueous fraction being more potent, exhibited 68.53 ± 4.45% fall in MAP (70 mmHg). In isolated rat aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (PE), Ra.Cr and fractions induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, which was partially blocked in presence of l-NAME, indomethacin and atropine. In isolated rabbit aortic rings pre-contracted with PE and K+-(80 mM), Ra.Cr induced vasorelaxation and shifted Ca2+ concentration-response curves to the right and suppressed PE peak formation, similar to verapamil, in Ca2+-free medium.
The data indicate that l-NAME and atropine-sensitive endothelial-derived NO and COX enzyme inhibitors and Ca2+ entry blocking-mediated vasodilator effect of the extract explain its antihypertensive potential.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by articular lesions, recruitment of inflammatory cells and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine. The intra-articular administration of zymosan is an experimental model that promotes inflammatory parameters resembling RA. Therefore, this model was used to investigate the efficacy of quercetin as a treatment of articular inflammation. Treatment with quercetin dose-dependently reduced zymosan-induced hyperalgesia, articular edema and the recruitment of neutrophils to the knee joint cavity. Histological analysis confirmed that quercetin inhibited zymosan-induced arthritis. The treatment with quercetin also inhibited zymosan-induced depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, TNFα and IL-1β production, and gp91phox, prepro-endothelin-1 (preproET-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression. These molecular effects of quercetin were related to the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-B and induction of Nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor (Nrf2)/home oxygenase (HO-1) pathway. Thus, quercetin exerted anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antioxidant effects in experimental arthritis, suggesting quercetin is a possible candidate for arthritis treatment.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease, affecting almost 1% of world population. Although the exact cause of RA is not known but the complex interaction between inflammatory mediators like tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide (NO) is accountable for cartilage destruction in joints. Gold is used for arthritis treatment since long without knowing its mechanism of action. Hence, the present study was designed to assess antiarthritic activity of nanogold (AuNGs) in collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rat model by virtue of decreasing inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. After induction CIA rats were treated with AuNGs in phosphate buffer at a dose of 20 μg/kg body weight for 20 days and found a significant decrease in the level of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2 and transcription factor NF-kB (Nuclear factor-kB), which was found to be elevated in CIA rats. Additionally imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status were determined and perceived that AuNGs remarkably attenuates the imbalance in level of antioxidant and oxidant near to normal. In consistent to biochemical results, mRNA expression of NF-kB, TNF-α, COX-2, and iNOS were also up-regulated in CIA rats, which were considerably down regulated by AuNGs treatment. These findings were positively correlated with the histological results of joints, displayed reduced inflammation and bone erosion in treated group. This study demonstrates the ability of AuNGs to ameliorate production of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress in CIA rats. Induction of arthritis in rats showed increased inflammation, which activate the transcription factor NF-kB through activation of of IkB kinases (IKK) and ubiquination/proteosome degradation of IKB and transportation of activated NF-kB from cytoplasm to nucleus. In nucleus activated NF-kB bind to the promoter region of target gene and up regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX-2 and other inflammatory mediators that leads to cartilage destruction. AuNGs inhibit the activation of NF-kB and other inflammatory mediators and attenuate inflammation and cartilage destruction. COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; IKK: IkB kinases; IKB: I Kappa B; IL-1β: interleukin-6; IL-6: interleukin-6; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; NF-kB: nuclear transcription factor kappa B; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TNF-α: tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
The quality of Chinese medicine (CM) has being an active and challenging research area for CM. Prof. Chang-Xiao Liu et al first proposed the concept of quality marker (Q-Marker) for the quality evaluation and control on CM. This article describe the exploratory studies of Q-Marker in salvianolic acids for injection (SAI) based on this new concept.
This study was designed to screen Q-Marker of SAI and establish its quality control method based on the concept of CM Q-Marker.
Based on the concept of CM Q-Marker, the SAI was investigated for the identification of chemical components and their sources. The pharmacological effects on cerebral ischemia and reperfusion induced injury in rats were also investigated. Furthermore, the target cell extracts and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to screen Q-Markers. Finally, the fingerprints and determination based on Q-Markers were established to assess the quality of SAI more effectively.
Overall, 20 constituents in SAI were identified. It was found that salvianolic acid B (SA-B), rosmarinic acid (RA), lithospermic acid (LA), salvianolic acid D (SA-D) and salvianolic acid Y (SA-Y) are major chemical components of SAI. Based on chemical components identifications, analysis of their sources, target cell extracts and pharmacokinetic studies, four phenolic acids, namely SA-B, RA, LA and SA-D, were screened and determined as effective Q-Markers of SAI.
This study demonstrated that the described method is a powerful approach for detecting Q-Markers, which can be used as control index for the quality assessment of CM.
N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and were considered useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, several studies suggested that n-3 PUFAs attenuated arthritis in animal model and human, however the mechanism is still unclear. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells which cause tissue inflammation and bone erosion leading to joint destruction. In contrast, regulatory T (Treg) cells down-regulate various immune responses by suppression of naïve T cells. The imbalance between Th17 cells and Tregs cell is important for the pathogenesis of RA. Here, we investigated whether n-3 PUFAs attenuate arthritis in collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. We used fat-1 transgenic mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans fat-1 gene encoding an n-3 fatty acid desaturase that converts n-6 to n-3 fatty acids, leading to abundant n-3 fatty acids without the need of a dietary n-3 supply. Clinical arthritis score was significantly attenuated in fat-1 mice compared to wild type (WT) mice on day 7 (1.6±1.8, p = 0.012) and day 9 (1.5±1.6, p = 0.003). Ankle thickness also decreased significantly in fat-1 mice compared to WT mice (1.82±0.11, p = 0.008). The pathologic finding showed that inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction were reduced in fat-1 mice compared to WT. The expression levels of IL-17 and related cytokines including IL-6 and IL-23 decreased in the spleen and ankle joint tissue of fat-1 mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, Treg cells were expanded in the spleen of fat-1 mice and Treg cell differentiation was significantly higher in fat-1 mice than in wild type (p = 0.038). These data suggest that n-3 PUFAs could attenuate arthritis through increasing the expression of FoxP3 and the differentiation of Treg, while reducing IL-17 production. Therefore, dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA.
Vitamin A is important for the circadian timing system; deficiency disrupts daily rhythms in activity and clock gene expression, and reduces the nocturnal peak in melatonin in the pineal gland. However, it is currently unknown how these effects are mediated. Vitamin A primarily acts via the active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), a transcriptional regulator with emerging non-genomic activities. We investigated whether RA is subject to diurnal variation in synthesis and signaling in the rat pineal gland. Its involvement in two key molecular rhythms in this gland was also examined: kinase activation and induction of Aanat, which encodes the rhythm-generating melatonin synthetic enzyme. We found diurnal changes in expression of several genes required for RA signaling, including a RA receptor and synthetic enzymes. The RA-responsive gene Cyp26a1 was found to change between day and night, suggesting diurnal changes in RA activity. This corresponded to changes in RA synthesis, suggesting rhythmic production of RA. Long-term RA treatment in vitro upregulated Aanat transcription, while short-term treatment had no effect. RA was also found to rapidly downregulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a rapid non-genomic action which may be involved in driving the molecular rhythm in ERK1/2 activation in this gland. These results demonstrate that there are diurnal changes in RA synthesis and activity in the rat pineal gland which are partially under circadian control. These may be key to the effects of vitamin A on circadian rhythms, therefore providing insight into the molecular link between this nutrient and the circadian system.
Elevated concentrations of homocysteine have been previously identified as an independent risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Given that heightened homocysteine levels are known to be strongly influenced by genetic factors, in the current study we investigated the contribution of high homocysteine levels as well as of functional polymorphisms of the gene encoding for the enzyme 5, 10- methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to atherosclerotic disease characterizing SLE patients.
Peripheral DNA samples from 150 SLE patients, 214 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 561 age/sex matched apparently healthy volunteers (HC) were genotyped by PCR-based assays for the detection of the MTHFR gene polymorphisms (c. 677C &gt; T and c. 1298A &gt; C). All SLE patients and 30 age sex matched RA patients underwent assessment for subclinical atherosclerosis [ultrasound measurement of intima-media thickness scores (IMT) and detection of carotid and/or femoral (C/F) plaque] and complete clinical and laboratory evaluation including serum homocysteine levels. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models (SPSS 21.0).
Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 26.0% of SLE patients compared to 6.7% of age/sex matched RA controls (p = 0.02). Higher serum B12 levels and decreased frequency of the MTHFR 677TT variant in RA patients could potentially account for the observed differences between the groups. In SLE patients, both hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR 677TT genotype were identified as independent contributors for plaque formation, following adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and disease related features, including age, sex, BMI, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, presence of arterial hypertension, smoking (pack/years), disease duration and total steroid dose [OR 95% (CI): 5.8 (1.0-35.8) and 5.2 (1.1-24.0), respectively]. MTHFR 677TT genotype, but not hyperhomocysteinemia was also found to confer increased risk for arterial wall thickening, after the above confounders were taken into account [OR (95%) CI: 4.9 (1.2-20.6)].
Hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR 677TT genetic variant emerged as independent risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE patients, implying genetic influences as potential contributors to the increased burden of atherosclerotic disease characterizing SLE.
TP53 is a widely studied tumor suppressor gene that controls various cellular functions, including cell differentiation. However, little is known about its functional roles in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). SMC differentiation is at the heart of our understanding of vascular development, normal blood pressure homeostasis, and the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis, as well as aneurysm. Using retinoid acid (RA)-induced SMC differentiation models, we observed that p53 expression is increased during in vitro differentiation of mouse ESCs into SMCs. Meanwhile, suppression of p53 by shRNA reduced RA-induced SMC differentiation. Mechanistically, we have identified for the first time that Myocardin, a transcription factor that induces muscle cell differentiation and muscle-specific gene expression, is the direct target of p53 by bioinformatic analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches. Moreover, in vivo SMC-selective p53 transgenic overexpression inhibited injury-induced neointimal formation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that p53 and its target gene, Myocardin, play regulatory roles in SMC differentiation. This study may lead to the identification of novel target molecules that may, in turn, lead to novel drug discoveries for the treatment of vascular diseases.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease with the characteristics of progressive joint destruction, deformity, and disability. Epigenetic changes have been implicated in the development of some autoimmune disorders, resulting in an alteration of gene transcription. Here, we investigated how Jumonji C family of histone demethylases (JMJD3) regulated the proliferation and activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), which are involved in RA joint destruction and pathologic process. The JMJD3 expression and proliferation markers in RA-FLS were higher than those in healthy-FLS and were upregulated in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced FLS. Elevated JMJD3 promoted the proliferation and migration of FLS. Treatment with JMJD3 small interfering RNA or inhibitor glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) J4 led to decreased proliferation and migration of FLS. Interestingly, induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a major player of the cell-cycle regulation, was correlated with trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 loss around the gene promoters. The knockdown of JMJD3 abolished PCNA expression in PDGF-induced FLS and further inhibited cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that JMJD3/PCNA played a crucial role in aspects of FLS proliferation and migration. In vivo, the ability of GSK J4 to hinder collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice was evaluated. We found that GSK J4 markedly attenuated the severity of arthritis in CIA mice. The therapeutic effects were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced bone erosion and destruction. This study revealed how JMJD3 integrated with epigenetic processes to regulate RA-FLS proliferation and invasion. These data suggested that JMJD3 might contribute to rheumatoid synovial hyperplasia and have the potential as a novel therapeutic target for RA.-Jia, W., Wu, W., Yang, D., Xiao, C., Su, Z., Huang, Z., Li, Z., Qin, M., Huang, M., Liu, S., Long, F., Mao, J., Liu, X., Zhu, Y. Z. Histone demethylase JMJD3 regulates fibroblast-like synoviocyte-mediated proliferation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.
The clearance of retinoic acid (RA) and its metabolites is believed to be regulated by the CYP26 enzymes, but the specific roles of CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP26C1 in clearing active vitamin A metabolites have not been defined. The goal of this study was to establish the substrate specificity of CYP26C1, and determine whether CYP26C1 interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs). CYP26C1 was found to effectively metabolize all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), 13-cis-retinoic acid, and 4-oxo-atRA with the highest intrinsic clearance toward 9-cis-RA. In comparison with CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, CYP26C1 resulted in a different metabolite profile for retinoids, suggesting differences in the active-site structure of CYP26C1 compared with other CYP26s. Homology modeling of CYP26C1 suggested that this is attributable to the distinct binding orientation of retinoids within the CYP26C1 active site. In comparison with other CYP26 family members, CYP26C1 was up to 10-fold more efficient in clearing 4-oxo-atRA (intrinsic clearance 153 μl/min/pmol) than CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, suggesting that CYP26C1 may be important in clearing this active retinoid. In support of this, CRABPs delivered 4-oxo-atRA and atRA for metabolism by CYP26C1. Despite the tight binding of 4-oxo-atRA and atRA with CRABPs, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant in biological matrix (Km) value of these substrates with CYP26C1 was not increased when the substrates were bound with CRABPs, in contrast to what is predicted by free drug hypothesis. Together these findings suggest that CYP26C1 is a 4-oxo-atRA hydroxylase and may be important in regulating the concentrations of this active retinoid in human tissues.
Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXLD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
To explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of HLXLD on anti-inflammatory activity.
A metabolomic approach based on UFLC-MS/MS to profile arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic changes was used. The cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) catalyzed metabolites in plasma were quantified on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the rats injected with Complete Freund's adjuvant and orally administrated with HLXLD, methotrexate and dexamethasone in parallel as the positive control drugs.
Nineteen metabolites involved in COX and LOX pathways in RA model group were significant increased compared with normal group (P &lt; 0.05), including 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 15-HETE, 8-HETE, leukotriene B4(LTB4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGI2, PGD2, PGF2α, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), etc. From day 7 to day 28, the trajectory direction of HLXLD group and positive control groups gradually moved towards the initial space, and the concentrations of AA and its metabolites after HLXLD treatment were significantly reduced in dual pathways compared to control groups.
HLXLD induced a substantial change in the AA metabolic profiles through refrain the expression of COX and LOX. The present investigation also highlights that distinct ingredients of this formula tend to inhibit different target to achieve a therapeutic effect.
CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, is disrupted in CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variably penetrant abnormalities in craniofacial, cardiac, and nervous system tissues. The inner ear is uniquely sensitive to CHD7 levels and is the most commonly affected organ in individuals with CHARGE. Interestingly, upregulation or downregulation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling during embryogenesis also leads to developmental defects similar to those in CHARGE syndrome, suggesting that CHD7 and RA may have common target genes or signaling pathways. Here, we tested three separate potential mechanisms for CHD7 and RA interaction: (a) direct binding of CHD7 with RA receptors, (b) regulation of CHD7 levels by RA, and (c) CHD7 binding and regulation of RA-related genes. We show that CHD7 directly regulates expression of Aldh1a3, the gene encoding the RA synthetic enzyme ALDH1A3 and that loss of Aldh1a3 partially rescues Chd7 mutant mouse inner ear defects. Together, these studies indicate that ALDH1A3 acts with CHD7 in a common genetic pathway to regulate inner ear development, providing insights into how CHD7 and RA regulate gene expression and morphogenesis in the developing embryo.
The expression pattern of genes coding for enzymes of the retinoic acid (RA) synthetic and degradation pathways was characterized in adult female zebrafish Danio rerio. Females were conditioned until maturation and post-spawn expression dynamics were determined. A striking upregulation of cyp26b1, but not cyp26a1, was observed following egg deposition, decreasing to initial levels during recovery. A similar, yet lower, fluctuation was observed for aldh1a2 and rdh10a, the enzymes participating in the two-step RA biosynthesis cascade. The present work highlights the dynamics of the adult D. rerio oogenesis and uncovers novel, yet elusive, metabolic contributors. Possible compartmentalized roles for the different gene paralogue isoforms are discussed.
Aberrant histone lysine methylation (HKM) has been reported in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (SFs). As histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) and demethylases (HKDMs) regulate HKM, these enzymes are believed to be dysregulated in RASFs. The aim of this study is to clarify whether gene expressions of HKMTs and HKDMs are altered in RASFs.
SFs were isolated from synovial tissues obtained from RA or osteoarthritis (OA) patients during total knee joint replacement. The mRNA levels of 34 HKMTs and 22 HKDMs were examined after stimulation with tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in RASFs and OASFs.
The gene expression of the 12 HKMTs, including MLL1, MLL3, SUV39H1, SUV39H2, PRDM2, EZH2, SETD2, NSD2, NSD3, SMYD4, DOT1, and PR-set7, that catalyse the methylation of H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, or H4K20 was higher after TNFα stimulation in RASFs vs. OASFs. The gene expression of the 4 HKDMs, including FBXL10, NO66, JMJD2D, and FBXL11, that catalyse the methylation of H3K4, H3K9, or H3K36 was higher after TNFα stimulation in RASFs vs. OASFs.
The study findings suggest that the HKM-modifying enzymes are involved in the alteration of HKM, which results in changes in the gene expression of RASFs.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory mediator that is involved in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previously, we demonstrated a small molecule compound 3-[(biphenyl-4-ylcarbonyl) carbamothioyl] amino benzoic acid (Z-590) could inhibit MIF activity with docking-based virtual screening and experimental evaluation.
The LPS activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells were used to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of Z-590 in vitro. A rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model was used to determine the anti-arthritic effects of Z-590 in vivo.
MIF inhibitor Z-590 significantly inhibited the production of NO, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and markedly inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Z-590 also significantly reduced paw edema, serum level of TNF-α, IL-6 and spleen index in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. Furthermore, Z-590 markedly ameliorated joint inflammation and articular cartilage damage in AIA rat model.
MIF inhibitor Z-590 possesses potent anti-arthritic activity through suppression of macrophage activation, and could be a potential therapeutic treatment for RA.
Initiation of spermatogenesis in primates is triggered at puberty by an increase in gonadotropins; i.e., follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prior to puberty, testis of the monkey contains only undifferentiated germ cells. However, sermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis may be initiated prior to puberty after stimulation with exogenous LH and FSH. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is considered to be a major component that drives spermatogonial differentiation. We were interested in evaluating the relative role of LH and FSH, either alone or in combination, in regulating the retinoic acid signaling in monkey testis. Sixteen juvenile male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were infused with intermittent recombinant single chain human LH (schLH) or recombinant human FSH (rhFSH) or a combination of both for 11 days. We then analyzed the expression of the several putative RA signaling pathway related genes; i.e. RDH10, RDH11, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, CYP26B1, CRABP1, CRABP2, STRA6, STRA8 in the testis after 11 days of stimulation with vehicle, LH, FSH and combination LH/FSH using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The qPCR results analysis showed that administration of gonadotropins affected a significant change in expression of some RA signaling related genes in the monkey testis. The gonadotropins, either alone or in combination dramatically increased expression of CRABP2 (p≤0.001), whereas there was a decrease in ALDH1A2 expression (p≤0.001). Moreover, combined gonadotropin treatment led to the significant decrease in CRABP1 expression (p≤0.05). These findings are the first evidence that the activity of retinoic acid signaling in the monkey testis is regulated through gonadotropins (LH/FSH) levels.
The purpose of this research was to explore the behavior of aquaporins (AQPs) in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease that is a recurrent neurodegenerative disorder caused by the gradual, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Because of postmortem studies have provided evidences for oxidative damage and alteration of water flow and energy metabolism, we carried out an investigation about AQP4 and 9, demonstrated in the brain to maintain water and energy homeostasis. As an appropriate in vitro cell model, we used SH-SY5Y cultures and induced their differentiation into a mature dopaminergic neuron phenotype with retinoic acid (RA) alone or in association with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (MPA). The association RA plus MPA provided the most complete and mature neuron phenotype, as demonstrated by high levels of β-Tubulin III, MAP-2, and tyrosine hydroxylase. After validation of cell differentiation, the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and H2O2 were applied to reproduce a Parkinson's-like stress. The results confirmed RA/MPA differentiated SH-SY5Y as a useful in vitro system for studying neurotoxicity and for using in a MPTP and H2O2-induced Parkinson's disease cell model. Moreover, the data demonstrated that neuronal differentiation, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress are strongly correlated with dynamic changes of AQP4 and 9 transcription and transduction. New in vitro and in vivo experiments are needed to confirm these innovative outcomes.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease occurring in larger population, characterized by synovial inflammation followed by destruction of joint. Major concerned factor for cause of RA has been related to oxidative stress due to environmental toxicity and immune imbalance. Reactive oxygen species generated from macrophages communes series of oxidation at cellular and genetic level and leads to generation of inflammatory cytokines for provoking inflammation in RA. Superoxide dismutase and catalase are supposed to be potential antioxidant enzymes to scavange free radicals. However, many clinical studies report reduced potency of enzyme due to lack of its targeting efficacy. Therefore, the aim of the work involves development of nanomatrix mimicking as catalase over which folate-linked superoxide dismutase was adsorbed for a macrophage targeting. The developed formulation was optimized, characterized for morphological studies, enzyme loading efficiency, protein activity, and in vitro drug release. Quantification of interleukin 6 was performed by indirect enzyme linked immunosborent assay over macrophage cell lines to determine in vitro treatment efficacy. It is concluded that the prepared system can act as enzyme reservoir to deliver acid labile enzymes in controlled form to efficiently treat RA.
The anti-inflammatory effect of abatacept is most pronounced in patients with high-titer autoantibodies (including anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA] and rheumatoid factor [RF]). Considering that autoantibodies trigger inflammatory cytokine production by monocytes and that abatacept binds to monocytes, influencing their functional state, we hypothesized that abatacept may effectively inhibit the production of several different cytokines by ACPA- or RF-challenged monocytes.
Peripheral blood CD68+ monocytes stimulated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 24 h were exposed to random immunoglobulin G alone (negative control), purified ACPA, purified RF, or lipopolysaccharide (positive control) in cell culture plates coated with citrullinated vimentin (to allow ACPA immune complex formation). Stimulations were done in the presence or absence of abatacept or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody (adalimumab) with or without indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor 1-methyl-D-tryptophan. Supernatants were analyzed for key proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) after 24 h.
Exposure to ACPA or RF significantly induced the production of TNF-α (20-fold and 27-fold, respectively), IL-1β (each 4-fold), IL-6 (12-fold and 11-fold, respectively), IL-8 (43-fold and 30-fold, respectively), and CCL2 (each 4-fold) in human monocytes. Abatacept inhibited this autoantibody-mediated upregulation of cytokines, reducing TNF-α by &gt; 75%, IL-1β by &gt; 65%, IL-6 and IL-8 by &gt; 80%, and CCL2 by &gt; 60%. In contrast, a TNF inhibitor did not influence autoantibody-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. IDO inhibition reversed the effect of abatacept and again permitted the induction of cytokine production by ACPA and RF.
These data show that abatacept interferes with autoantibody-mediated cytokine production by monocytes through induction of IDO. This inhibitory effect on the production of several effector cytokines in RA may explain the fast anti-inflammatory effect of abatacept as well as its preferential efficacy in patients with high-titer ACPA and RF.
Spermatogenesis in mammals occurs in a very highly organized manner within the seminiferous epithelium regulated by different cell types in the testis. Testosterone produced by Leydig cells regulates blood-testis barrier formation, meiosis, spermiogenesis, and spermiation. However, it is unknown whether Leydig cell function changes with the different stages of the seminiferous epithelium. This study utilized the WIN 18,446 and retinoic acid (RA) treatment regime combined with the RiboTag mouse methodology to synchronize male germ cell development and allow for the in vivo mapping of the Leydig cell translatome across the different stages of one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Using microarrays analysis, we identified 11 Leydig cell-enriched genes that were expressed in stage-specific manner such as the glucocorticoid synthesis and transport genes, Cyp21a1 and Serpina6. In addition, there were nine Leydig cell transcripts that change their association with polysomes in correlation with the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle including Egr1. Interestingly, the signal intensity of EGR1 and CYP21 varied among Leydig cells in the adult asynchronous testis. However, testosterone levels across the different stages of germ cell development did not cycle. These data show, for the first time, that Leydig cell gene expression changes in a stage-specific manner during the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and indicate that a heterogeneous Leydig cell population exists in the adult mouse testis.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) have been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities, while its role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. Citrullinated fibrinogen (cfb) has been considered as a specific autoantigen in RA pathogenesis. Our study aims to determine the role of cfb on immunomodulatory function of BMSC. We demonstrated the specific role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB pathway in the pro-inflammatory response of BMSC to cfb with increased production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and chemokine CC motif ligand 2 (CCL2). Moreover, cfb impaired BMSC-mediated suppression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation and reduced the production of the key immunomodulatory molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in BMSC. We have uncovered a previously unrecognized role of cfb in interfering BMSC-mediated immunoregulation in RA. Cfb could act as a damage-associated molecule pattern (DAMP) for BMSC and thereby contribute to the propagation of inflammation in RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a vital morphogen for early patterning and organogenesis in the developing embryo. RA is a diffusible, lipophilic molecule that signals via nuclear RA receptor heterodimeric units that regulate gene expression by interacting with RA response elements in promoters of a significant number of genes. For precise RA signaling, a robust gradient of the morphogen is required. The developing embryo contains regions that produce RA, and specific intracellular concentrations of RA are created through local degradation mediated by Cyp26 enzymes. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which RA executes precise developmental programs, the kinetics of RA metabolism must be clearly understood. Recent advances in techniques for endogenous RA detection and quantification have paved the way for mechanistic studies to shed light on downstream gene expression regulation coordinated by RA. It is increasingly coming to light that RA signaling operates not only at precise concentrations but also employs mechanisms of degradation and feedback inhibition to self-regulate its levels. A global gradient of RA throughout the embryo is often found concurrently with several local gradients, created by juxtaposed domains of RA synthesis and degradation. The existence of such local gradients has been found especially critical for the proper development of craniofacial structures that arise from the neural crest and the cranial placode populations. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how local gradients of RA are established in the embryo and their impact on craniofacial development.
Salvia miltiorrhiza is a medicinal plant widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Hydrophilic phenolic acids, including rosmarinic acid (RA) and lithospermic acid B (LAB), are its primary medicinal ingredients. However, the biosynthetic pathway of RA and LAB in S. miltiorrhiza is still poorly understood. In the present study, we accomplished the isolation and characterization of a novel S. miltiorrhiza Hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (HPPR) gene, SmHPPR, which plays an important role in the biosynthesis of RA. SmHPPR contained a putative catalytic domain and a NAD(P)H-binding motif. The recombinant SmHPPR enzyme exhibited high HPPR activity, converting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (pHPP) to 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (pHPL), and exhibited the highest affinity for substrate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. SmHPPR expression could be induced by various treatments, including SA, GA3, MeJA and Ag+, and the changes in SmHPPR activity were correlated well with hydrophilic phenolic acid accumulation. SmHPPR was localized in cytoplasm, most likely close to the cytosolic NADPH-dependent hydroxypyruvate reductase active in photorespiration. In addition, the transgenic S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots overexpressing SmHPPR exhibited up to 10-fold increases in the products of hydrophilic phenolic acid pathway. In conclusion, our findings provide a new insight into the synthesis of active pharmaceutical compounds at molecular level.
To identify the commonalities between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) to understand the mechanisms of Chinese medicine (CM) in different diseases with the same treatment.
A text mining approach was adopted to analyze the commonalities between RA and DM according to CM and biological elements. The major commonalities were subsequently verified in RA and DM rat models, in which herbal formula for the treatment of both RA and DM identified via text mining was used as the intervention.
Similarities were identified between RA and DM regarding the CM approach used for diagnosis and treatment, as well as the networks of biological activities affected by each disease, including the involvement of adhesion molecules, oxidative stress, cytokines, T-lymphocytes, apoptosis, and inflammation. The Ramulus Cinnamomi-Radix Paeoniae Alba-Rhizoma Anemarrhenae is an herbal combination used to treat RA and DM. This formula demonstrated similar effects on oxidative stress and inflammation in rats with collagen-induced arthritis, which supports the text mining results regarding the commonalities between RA and DM.
Commonalities between the biological activities involved in RA and DM were identified through text mining, and both RA and DM might be responsive to the same intervention at a specific stage.
Alcohol consumption during pregnancy induces Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which has been proposed to arise from competitive inhibition of retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis. We provide biochemical and developmental evidence identifying acetaldehyde as responsible for this inhibition. In the embryo, RA production by RALDH2 (ALDH1A2), the main retinaldehyde dehydrogenase expressed at that stage, is inhibited by ethanol exposure. Pharmacological inhibition of the embryonic alcohol dehydrogenase activity, prevents the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde that in turn functions as a RALDH2 inhibitor. Acetaldehyde-mediated reduction of RA can be rescued by RALDH2 or retinaldehyde supplementation. Enzymatic kinetic analysis of human RALDH2 shows a preference for acetaldehyde as a substrate over retinaldehyde. RA production by hRALDH2 is efficiently inhibited by acetaldehyde but not by ethanol itself. We conclude that acetaldehyde is the teratogenic derivative of ethanol responsible for the reduction in RA signaling and induction of the developmental malformations characteristic of FASD. This competitive mechanism will affect tissues requiring RA signaling when exposed to ethanol throughout life.
During development, morphogens, such as retinoic acid (RA), act as mediators of intercellular communication systems to control patterning and cell fate specification processes. In vertebrates, the tightly regulated production and degradation of RA creates an anterior-posterior (A-P) morphogen gradient that is required for regional patterning of the embryo. RA catabolism in particular, mediated by members of the cytochrome P450 subfamily 26 (CYP26), has been highlighted as a key regulatory component for the formation of this gradient. RA-dependent developmental patterning is now widely recognized as a shared feature of all chordate groups (i.e. of vertebrates, tunicates, and cephalochordates). However, the evolutionary origin of the RA morphogen gradient still remains elusive. Thus, in the present study, we used pharmacological approaches to assess the roles of CYP26 enzymes in tissue-specific patterning processes in embryos and larvae of the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum). Marker gene analyses revealed selective requirements for CYP26 activity in anterior endoderm, general ectoderm as well as central nervous system (CNS), but not in mesoderm. Furthermore, comparisons of the effects induced by CYP26 inhibition with those obtained by the pharmacological upregulation or downregulation of global RA signaling levels yielded evidence for a role of CYP26 in establishing an A-P RA gradient in the amphioxus embryo, important at least for patterning the CNS. Altogether, this work hence highlights the involvement of CYP26 in tissue-specific modulations of RA signaling activity in the amphioxus embryo and suggests that a RA morphogen gradient already functioned in the last common ancestor of all chordates.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) are reportedly involved in RA initiation, progression, and perpetuation. Previously a study showed that retinoid interferon-induced mortality 19 (GRIM19) improved the clinical and histological features of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA),and also inhibited osteoclast formation. However, the role of GRIM19 in RA-FLS remains unclear. In this study, we explored the biological function and underlying mechanism of GRIM19 in cultured RA-FLS. The expression of GRIM19 in synovial tissues and RA-FLS was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR(qRT-PCR).The effects of GRIM19 on proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines levels in RA-FLS were determined using CCK8, wound healing, transwell invasion, and flow cytometry assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.GRIM19 and its related protein expression levels were determined by western blot. We found that GRIM19expression was significantly decreased in synovial tissues and FLS from RA patients.GRIM19significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted apoptosis; and suppressed inflammatory cytokine secretion by RA-FLS. Moreover, GRIM19 overexpression significantly decreasedthe expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3)and its downstreamproteins,CyclinD1, Bcl-2, and MMP-9. These data indicate that promoting the expression of GRIM19 may yield therapeutic benefits in the treatment of RA.
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes, important in immune surveillance and elimination of stressed, transformed, or virus-infected cells. They critically shape the inflammatory cytokine environment to orchestrate interactions of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Some studies have reported that NK cell activation and cytokine secretion are controlled epigenetically but have yielded only limited insight into the mechanisms. Using chemical screening with small-molecule inhibitors of chromatin methylation and acetylation, further validated by knockdown approaches, we here identified Jumonji-type histone H3K27 demethylases as key regulators of cytokine production in human NK cell subsets. The prototypic JMJD3/UTX (Jumonji domain-containing protein 3) H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 increased global levels of the repressive H3K27me3 mark around transcription start sites of effector cytokine genes. Moreover, GSK-J4 reduced IFN-γ, TNFα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-10 levels in cytokine-stimulated NK cells while sparing their cytotoxic killing activity against cancer cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of GSK-J4 in NK cell subsets, isolated from peripheral blood or tissue from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coupled with an inhibitory effect on formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, suggested that histone demethylase inhibition has broad utility for modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Overall, our results indicate that H3K27me3 is a dynamic and important epigenetic modification during NK cell activation and that JMJD3/UTX-driven H3K27 demethylation is critical for NK cell function.
Rare variants are considered underlying causes of complex diseases. The complex and severe group of disorders called neural tube defects (NTDs) results from failure of the neural tube to close during early embryogenesis. Neural tube closure requires the coordination of numerous signaling pathways, including the precise regulation of retinoic acid (RA) concentration, which is controlled by enzymes involved in RA synthesis and degradation. Here, we used a case-control mutation screen study to reveal rare variants in retinoid-related genes in a Han Chinese NTD population by sequencing six genes in 355 NTD cases and 225 controls. More specific rare variants were found in exonic and upstream regions in NTD cases. The RA-responsive genes CYP26A1, CRABP1, and ALDH1A2 harbored NTD-specific rare variants in their upstream regions. Unexpectedly, the majority of missense variants in NTD cases were found in CYP26B1, which encodes a RA degradation enzyme, whereas no missense variants in this gene were found in controls. Functional analysis indicated that the CYP26B1 NTD variants were inefficient in the degradation of RA using assays of RA-induced transcription and RA-initiated neuronal differentiation. Our study supports the contribution of rare variants in RA-related genes to the etiology of human NTDs.
Epigenetic modifications have previously been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we aimed to determine whether differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood cell subpopulations is associated with any of 4 clinical outcomes among RA patients.
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 63 patients in the University of California, San Francisco RA cohort (all satisfied the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; 57 were seropositive for rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated protein). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to separate the cells into 4 immune cell subpopulations (CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ naive T cells, and CD4+ memory T cells) per individual, and 229 epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles were generated using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Differentially methylated positions and regions associated with the Clinical Disease Activity Index score, erosive disease, RA Articular Damage score, Sharp score, medication at time of blood draw, smoking status, and disease duration were identified using robust regression models and empirical Bayes variance estimators.
Differential methylation of CpG sites associated with clinical outcomes was observed in all 4 cell types. Hypomethylated regions in the CYP2E1 and DUSP22 gene promoters were associated with active and erosive disease, respectively. Pathway analyses suggested that the biologic mechanisms underlying each clinical outcome are cell type-specific. Evidence of independent effects on DNA methylation from smoking, medication use, and disease duration were also identified.
Methylation signatures specific to RA clinical outcomes may have utility as biomarkers or predictors of exposure, disease progression, and disease severity.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of kidney function and severe AKI needs renal replacement therapeutic strategy and has high mortality. RA-XII is a natural cyclopeptide, isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Rubia yunnanensis, exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. The present study aimed to explore the effects of RA-XII on LPS-induced ACI and the underlying molecular mechanism in TCMK-1 cells in vitro. The results indicated that RA-XII delayed the animal death caused by LPS in mice. The kidney histological changes were markedly attenuated by RA-XII. RA-XII also reduced the serum uric acid, creatinine, BUN and renal 8-OHdG. In addition, RA-XII suppressed LPS-induced oxidative stress in kidney, as evidenced by the up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) levels, and the down-regulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Additionally, RA-XII enhanced heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expressions in renal tissue sections. Further, RA-XII reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-18, in renal, which was linked to the inhibition of inhibitor of alpha/nuclear factor kappa B (IκBα/NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways. The in vitro study illustrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of RA-XII were partially reversed following Nrf2 and HO-1 inhibition. Together, these findings strongly suggested that RA-XII is a potential agent against acute kidney injury.
Stimulation of retinoic acid (RA) mediated signalling pathways following neural injury leads to regeneration in the adult nervous system and numerous studies have shown that the specific activation of the retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) is required for this process. Here we identify a novel mechanism by which neuronal RARβ activation results in the endogenous synthesis of RA which is released in association with exosomes and acts as a positive cue to axonal/neurite outgrowth. Using an established rodent model of RARβ induced axonal regeneration, we show that neuronal RARβ activation upregulates the enzymes involved in RA synthesis in a cell specific manner; alcohol dehydrogenase7 (ADH7) in neurons and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) in NG2 expressing cells (NG2+ cells). These release RA in association with exosomes providing a permissive substrate to neurite outgrowth. Conversely, deletion of Raldh2 in the NG2+ cells in our in vivo regeneration model is sufficient to compromise axonal outgrowth. This hitherto unidentified RA paracrine signalling is required for axonal/neurite outgrowth and is initiated by the activation of neuronal RARβ signalling.
Thyroid autoimmunity is more common in patients with rheumatic diseases than in healthy populations. The degree of association seems subject to influence from patients' geographical location. Here, we aimed to ascertain the prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in a cohort of patients with systemic rheumatic disease and the degree of association between its presence and inflammatory activity.
Cross-sectional observational study in a rheumatology unit.
301 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 210 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 58 with scleroderma (SSc) and 80 with spondyloarthritis (SpA) were studied regarding thyroid function (TSH and T4), anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and anti-thyroperoxidase (TPOab) and compared with 141 healthy controls. Disease activity in patients with rheumatic disease was assessed through appropriate indexes.
There were more antithyroid antibodies in SLE patients with hypothyroidism (P = 0.01; odds ratio, OR 2.7; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.20-6.26) and in those without hypothyroidism (P = 0.06; OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.28-4.55) than in controls. SSc patients also showed: P = 0.03 both with antithyroid antibodies and hypothyroidism (OR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.06-10.80) and without hypothyroidism (OR 3.1; 95% CI: 1.11-0.13). RA and SpA patients had the same prevalence as controls (P not significant). Presence of autoantibodies with and without hypothyroidism was not associated with the activity or functional indexes evaluated.
SLE and SSc were associated with higher prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in patients with and without hypothyroidism, unlike SpA and RA. There was no link between thyroid autoantibody presence and disease activity or functional impairment.
Excess dietary fructose intake associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Previous animal studies have reported that diabetic animals have significantly impaired behavioural and cognitive functions, pathological synaptic function and impaired expression of glutamate receptors. Correction of the antioxidant status of laboratory rodents largely prevents the development of fructose-induced plurimetabolic changes in the nervous system. We suggest a novel concept of efficiency of Stevia leaves for treatment of central diabetic neuropathy.
By in vivo extracellular studies induced spike activity of hippocampal neurons during high frequency stimulation of entorhinal cortex, as well as neurons of basolateral amygdala to high-frequency stimulation of the hippocampus effects of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant evaluated in synaptic activity in the brain of fructose-enriched diet rats. In the conditions of metabolic disorders caused by fructose, antioxidant activity of Stevia rebaudiana was assessed by measuring the NOX activity of the hippocampus, amygdala and spinal cord.
In this study, the characteristic features of the metabolic effects of dietary fructose on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and basolateral amygdala and the state of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) oxidative system of these brain formations are revealed, as well as the prospects for development of multitarget and polyfunctional phytopreparations (with adaptogenic, antioxidant, antidiabetic, nootropic activity) from native raw material of Stevia rebaudiana. Stevia modulates degree of expressiveness of potentiation/depression (approaches but fails to achieve the norm) by shifting the percentage balance in favor of depressor type of responses during high-frequency stimulation, indicating its adaptogenic role in plasticity of neural networks. Under the action of fructose an increase (3-5 times) in specific quantity of total fraction of NOX isoforms isolated from the central nervous system tissue (amygdala, hippocampus, spinal cord) was revealed. Stevia exhibits an antistress, membrane-stabilizing role reducing the level of total fractions of NOX isoforms from central nervous system tissues and regulates NADPH-dependent O2- -producing activity.
Generally, in condition of metabolic disorders caused by intensive consumption of dietary fructose Stevia leaves contributes to the control of neuronal synaptic plasticity possibly influencing the conjugated NOX-specific targets.
Enzymes of the ALDH1A subfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenases are crucial in regulating retinoic acid (RA) signaling and have received attention as potential drug targets. ALDH1A2 is the primary RA-synthesizing enzyme in mammalian spermatogenesis and is therefore considered a viable drug target for male contraceptive development. However, only a small number of ALDH1A2 inhibitors have been reported, and information on the structure of ALDH1A2 was limited to the NAD-liganded enzyme void of substrate or inhibitors. Herein, we describe the mechanism of action of structurally unrelated reversible and irreversible inhibitors of human ALDH1A2 using direct binding studies and X-ray crystallography. All inhibitors bind to the active sites of tetrameric ALDH1A2. Compound WIN18,446 covalently reacts with the side chain of the catalytic residue Cys320, resulting in a chiral adduct in ( R) configuration. The covalent adduct directly affects the neighboring NAD molecule, which assumes a contracted conformation suboptimal for the dehydrogenase reaction. The reversible inhibitors interact predominantly through direct hydrogen bonding interactions with residues in the vicinity of Cys320 without affecting NAD. Upon interaction with inhibitors, a large flexible loop assumes regular structure, thereby shielding the active site from solvent. The precise knowledge of the binding modes provides a new framework for the rational design of novel inhibitors of ALDH1A2 with improved potency and selectivity profiles.
Heliozelidae are a widespread, evolutionarily early diverging family of small, day-flying monotrysian moths, for which a comprehensive phylogeny is lacking. We generated the first molecular phylogeny of the family using DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and two nuclear genes (H3 and 28S) from 130 Heliozelidae specimens, including eight of the twelve known genera: Antispila, Antispilina, Coptodisca, Heliozela, Holocacista, Hoplophanes, Pseliastis, and Tyriozela. Our results provide strong support for five major Heliozelidae clades: (i) a large widespread clade containing the leaf-mining genera Antispilina, Coptodisca and Holocacista and some species of Antispila, (ii) a clade containing most of the described Antispila, (iii) a clade containing the leaf-mining genus Heliozela and the monotypic genus Tyriozela, (iv) an Australian clade containing Pseliastis and (v) an Australian clade containing Hoplophanes. Each clade includes several new species and potentially new genera. Collectively, our data uncover a rich and undescribed diversity that appears to be especially prevalent in Australia. Our work highlights the need for a major taxonomic revision of the family and for generating a robust molecular phylogeny using multi-gene approaches in order to resolve the relationships among clades.
Integrated development of diverse tissues gives rise to a functional, mobile vertebrate musculoskeletal system. However, the genetics and cellular interactions that drive the integration of muscle, tendon, and skeleton are poorly understood. In the vertebrate head, neural crest cells, from which cranial tendons derive, pattern developing muscles just as tendons have been shown to in limb and trunk tissue, yet the mechanisms of this patterning are unknown. From a forward genetic screen, we determined that cyp26b1 is critical for musculoskeletal integration in the ventral pharyngeal arches, particularly in the mandibulohyoid junction where first and second arch muscles interconnect. Using time-lapse confocal analyses, we detail musculoskeletal integration in wild-type and cyp26b1 mutant zebrafish. In wild-type fish, tenoblasts are present in apposition to elongating muscles and condense in discrete muscle attachment sites. In the absence of cyp26b1, tenoblasts are generated in normal numbers but fail to condense into nascent tendons within the ventral arches and, subsequently, muscles project into ectopic locales. These ectopic muscle fibers eventually associate with ectopic tendon marker expression. Genetic mosaic analysis demonstrates that neural crest cells require Cyp26b1 function for proper musculoskeletal development. Using an inhibitor, we find that Cyp26 function is required in a short time window that overlaps the dynamic window of tenoblast condensation. However, cyp26b1 expression is largely restricted to regions between tenoblast condensations during this time. Our results suggest that degradation of RA by this previously undescribed population of neural crest cells is critical to promote condensation of adjacent scxa-expressing tenoblasts and that these condensations are subsequently required for proper musculoskeletal integration.
The membrane bound cytochrome b558 composed of gp91-phox and p22-phox proteins, and cytosolic proteins p40-, p47-and p67-phox are important components of superoxide (O2-)-generating system in phagocytes. Here, we describe that resveratrol, a pleiotropic phytochemical belonging to the stilbenoids, dramatically activates the O2--generating system during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells to macrophage-like cells. When U937 cells were cultured in the presence of RA and resveratrol, the O2--generating activity increased more than 5-fold compared with that in the absence of the latter. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that co-treatment with RA and resveratrol strongly enhanced transcription of the gp91-phox compared with those of the RA-treatment only. On the other hand, immunoblot analysis revealed that co-treatment with RA and resveratrol caused remarkable accumulation of protein levels of gp91-phox (to 4-fold), p22-phox (to 5-fold) and p47-phox (to 4-fold) compared with those of the RA-treatment alone. In addition, ChIP assay suggested that resveratrol participates in enhancing the gene expression of gp91-phox via promoting acetylation of Lys-9 residues and Lys-14 residues of histone H3 within chromatin around the promoter regions of the gene. These results suggested that resveratrol strongly enhances the RA-induced O2--generating activity via up-regulation of gp91-phox gene expression in U937 cells.
The specificity of enzymes for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as redox carriers can pose a significant hurdle for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications, where switching the specificity might be beneficial. We have developed an easy-to-use computational tool (CSR-SALAD) for the design of mutant libraries to simplify the process of reversing the cofactor specificity of an enzyme. Here, we describe the optimal use of this tool and present methods for its application in a laboratory setting.
Quercetin (QU) has been shown obvious anti-arthritic property in pre-clinical studies or clinical studies. Howbeit, the underlying mechanism of it is still not revealed distinctly and should be gotten further insight into. QU at a dosage of 150 mg/kg was administered orally in collagen-induced arthritis rats and then the clinical symptoms were monitored. The protein levels of Th17/Treg-related cytokines were determined by ELISA, and the mRNA levels of cytokines and transcription factors associated with the Th17 and Treg phenotypes were evaluated by real-time PCR, the proportions of Th17 and Treg cells were assessed by flow cytometry. The results showed that QU administration yielded an obvious mitigation of arthritic manifestations including high arthritic scores and paw edema, which was accompanied with decrement of Th17-related cytokines (IL-17A and IL-21) and increment of Treg-related cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β). QU decreased the percentage of Th17 cells, while increased the percentage of Treg cells. In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome which plays a crucial role in the development of RA was determined and found that the protein expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β were diminished by QU significantly. Moreover, the protein levels of inflammatory mediators which were recognized as chief culprits in inflammatory reaction were assayed. The contents of inflammatory mediators inclusive of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, PGE2, COX-2 and iNOS were down-regulated markedly by QU. But the inhibitory effect of QU on inflammatory mediators was nearly abolished by Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) siRNA. Taken together, QU attenuates CIA via modulating the Th17/Treg balance, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as activating HO-1-mediated anti-inflammatory response.
Few studies examining the association between oxidative stress and clinical parameters or disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test whether oxidative stress has any association with clinical parameters and disease activity in patients with RA.
In this post hoc cross-sectional study, 45 patients with RA treated with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) ± low-dose glucocorticoids ± nonsteroidal analgesics for at least 3 months were analysed. Oxidative stress parameters were malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), antioxidant potential (AOP) and nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA). Clinical parameters were pain, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and disease activity score (DAS28).
Plasma NSSA levels were significantly inversely correlated with tender joints count (r = -.304; P = .042), swollen joints count (r = -.342; P = .021) and DAS28 (r = -.396; P = .009). There were no significant correlations between MDA/SOD/AOP and any of clinical parameters or DAS28 (P &gt; .05 for all). Multiple regression analysis revealed that NSSA was an independent variable of DAS28 (β=-.243, P = .016).
The preliminary results demonstrate that plasma NSSA levels were inversely correlated with tender and swollen joints count and DAS28 and that NSSA was independently associated with DAS28, in patients with RA treated with traditional DMARDs; and provide initial support that NSSA may be used as a biomarker of disease activity in patients with RA.
Growth arrest-specific 1 (Gas1) is a pleiotropic protein that induces apoptosis of tumor cells and has important roles during development. Recently, the presence of two forms of Gas1 was reported: one attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor; and a soluble extracellular form shed by cells. Previously, we showed that Gas1 is expressed in different areas of the adult mouse CNS. Here, we report the levels of Gas1 mRNA protein in different regions and analyzed its expressions in glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic neurons. We found that Gas1 is expressed in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the Purkinje-molecular layer of the cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, and fastigial nucleus, as well as in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. In all cases, Gas1 was found in the cell bodies, but not in the neuropil. The Purkinje and the molecular layers show the highest levels of Gas1, whereas the granule cell layer has low levels. Moreover, we detected the expression and release of Gas1 from primary cultures of Purkinje cells and from hippocampal neurons as well as from neuronal cell lines, but not from cerebellar granular cells. In addition, using SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with retinoic acid as a neuronal model, we found that extracellular Gas1 promotes neurite outgrowth, increases the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, and stimulates the inhibition of GSK3β. These findings demonstrate that Gas1 is expressed and released by neurons and promotes differentiation, suggesting an important role for Gas1 in cellular signaling in the CNS.
Mammalian spermatogenesis is an elaborately organized differentiation process, starting with diploid spermatogonia, which include germ-line stem cells, and ending with haploid spermatozoa. The process involves four pivotal transitions occurring in physical proximity: spermatogonial differentiation, meiotic initiation, initiation of spermatid elongation, and release of spermatozoa. We report how the four transitions are coordinated in mice. Two premeiotic transitions, spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation, were known to be coregulated by an extrinsic signal, retinoic acid (RA). Our chemical manipulations of RA levels in mouse testes now reveal that RA also regulates the two postmeiotic transitions: initiation of spermatid elongation and spermatozoa release. We measured RA concentrations and found that they changed periodically, as also reflected in the expression patterns of an RA-responsive gene, STRA8; RA levels were low before the four transitions, increased when the transitions occurred, and remained elevated thereafter. We found that pachytene spermatocytes, which express an RA-synthesizing enzyme, Aldh1a2, contribute directly and significantly to RA production in testes. Indeed, chemical and genetic depletion of pachytene spermatocytes revealed that RA from pachytene spermatocytes was required for the two postmeiotic transitions, but not for the two premeiotic transitions. We conclude that the premeiotic transitions are coordinated by RA from Sertoli (somatic) cells. Once germ cells enter meiosis, pachytene spermatocytes produce RA to coordinate the two postmeiotic transitions. In combination, these elements underpin the spatiotemporal coordination of spermatogenesis and ensure its prodigious output in adult males.
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) comprise a unique form of non-apoptotic cell death exhibited by neutrophils, which occurs in a stepwise process termed NETosis. It has been postulated that NETosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum levels of NET remnants in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as potential associations between NET remnants and indicators of RA.
Serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes (NET remnants) were examined in 74 RA patients and 50 healthy controls using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between the levels of these complexes and indicators of RA were then statistically evaluated.
RA patients exhibited significantly higher levels of MPO-DNA complexes than the healthy controls, and these levels were associated with increased neutrophil counts and positivity for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA). Among the 63 ACPA-positive RA patients examined, those with ACPA titers &gt; 1600 U/mL showed significantly increased MPO-DNA levels. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined that the area under the curve for all 74 RA patients was 0.798, with a sensitivity of 91.9% and a specificity of 56.0%, while that for the ACPA-negative patients was 0.891, with a sensitivity and specificity of 81.8% and 84.0%, respectively.
The results of this study suggest that the disease status of RA is associated with increased NETosis. In particular, evaluation of serum MPO-DNA levels may comprise a useful complementary tool for discriminating RA patients from healthy individuals.
To examine the potential relationship among gene expression markers of adipose tissue browning, gut microbiota, and insulin sensitivity in humans.
Gut microbiota composition and gene markers of browning are analyzed in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue from morbidly obese subjects (n = 34). Plasma acetate is measured through 1 H NMR and insulin sensitivity using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Subjects with insulin resistance show an increase in the relative abundance (RA) of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria while RA of Firmicutes is decreased. In all subjects, Firmicutes RA is negatively correlated with HbA1c and fasting triglycerides, whereas Proteobacteria RA was negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Firmicutes RA is positively associated with markers of brown adipocytes (PRDM16, UCP1, and DIO2) in SAT, but not in VAT. Multivariate regression analysis indicates that Firmicutes RA contributes significantly to SAT PRDM16, UCP1, and DIO2 mRNA variance after controlling for age, BMI, HbA1c , or insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, Firmicutes RA, specifically those bacteria belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family, is positively associated with plasma acetate levels, which are also linked to SAT PRDM16 mRNA and insulin sensitivity.
Gut microbiota composition is linked to adipose tissue browning and insulin action in morbidly obese subjects, possibly through circulating acetate.
All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) inhibits adipogenesis in established preadipocyte cell lines. Dosing pharmacological amounts of RA reduces weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet, i.e. counteracts diet-induced obesity (DIO). The aldehyde dehydrogenase Raldh1 (Aldh1a1) functions as one of three enzymes that converts the retinol metabolite retinal into RA, and one of many proteins that contribute to RA homeostasis. Female Raldh1-ablated mice resist DIO. This phenotype contrasts with ablations of other enzymes and binding-proteins that maintain RA homeostasis, which gain adiposity. The phenotype observed prompted the conclusion that loss of Raldh1 causes an increase in adipose tissue retinal, and therefore, retinal functions independently of RA to prevent DIO. A second deduction proposed that low nM concentrations of RA stimulate adipogenesis, in contrast to higher concentrations. Using peer-reviewed LC/MS/MS assays developed and validated for quantifying tissue RA and retinal, we show that endogenous retinal and RA concentrations in adipose tissues from Raldh1-null mice do not correlate with the phenotype. Moreover, male Raldh1-null mice resist weight gain regardless of dietary fat content. Resistance to weight gain occurs during adolescence in both sexes. We show that RA concentrations as low as 1 nM, i.e. in the sub-physiological range, impair adipogenesis of embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type mice. Embryonic fibroblasts from Raldh1-null mice resist differentiating into adipocytes, but retain ability to generate RA. These fibroblasts remain sensitive to an RA receptor pan-agonist, and are not affected by an RA receptor pan-antagonist. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that retinal itself represses weight gain and adipogenesis independently of RA. Instead, the data indicate that Raldh1 functions as a retinal and atRA-independent promoter of adiposity during adolescence, and enhances adiposity through pre-adipocyte cell autonomous actions.
Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP) is a negative regulator of inflammation in arthritis model mice. In humans, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 4 (STEAP4) (human counterpart of TIARP) is also expressed in CD14+ monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, highly levels of exon 3-spliced variant STEAP4 (v-STEAP4) expression have been observed in porcine lung. The aim of this study is to elucidate the expression and functional role of v-STEAP4, comparing it with that of STEAP4, in the pathogenesis of arthritis. We identified v-STEAP4 in CD14+ cells. The expression of STEAP4 and v-STEAP4 was higher in patients with RA than in healthy participants. We also found that STEAP4 and v-STEAP4 were correlated positively with C-reactive protein and that their expression was decreased after treatment with an interleukin (IL)-6 antagonist in patients with RA. To investigate further the role of STEAP4 and v-STEAP4, we produced STEAP4 and v-STEAP4 over-expressing human monocytic cell lines (THP-1) for functional analysis. In the v-STEAP4 over-expressing cells, the production of IL-6 was suppressed significantly, but TNF-α was increased significantly through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that phosphorylated (p-)nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) was increased after LPS stimulation and degradation of nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor alpha (IκBα) was sustained, whereas p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) was decreased with v-STEAP4. We identified specific up-regulation of v-STEAP4 in RA monocytes. V-STEAP4 might play a crucial role in the production of TNF-α and IL-6 through NF-κB and STAT-3 pathways, resulting in the generation of RA.
The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a collection of human neurological disorders with heterogeneous etiologies. Hyperactivity of E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase UBE3A, stemming from 15q11-q13 copy number variations, accounts for 1%-3% of ASD cases worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. Here we report that the functionality of ALDH1A2, the rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, is negatively regulated by UBE3A in a ubiquitylation-dependent manner. Excessive UBE3A dosage was found to impair RA-mediated neuronal homeostatic synaptic plasticity. ASD-like symptoms were recapitulated in mice by overexpressing UBE3A in the prefrontal cortex or by administration of an ALDH1A antagonist, whereas RA supplements significantly alleviated excessive UBE3A dosage-induced ASD-like phenotypes. By identifying reduced RA signaling as an underlying mechanism in ASD phenotypes linked to UBE3A hyperactivities, our findings introduce a new vista of ASD etiology and facilitate a mode of therapeutic development against this increasingly prevalent disease.
Our previous experiments found that lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) may be a useful preclinical serological marker for pulmonary fibrosis in the mouse model. The role of LOXL2 in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is still unclear. We investigated whether serum LOXL2 levels are associated with RA-ILD patients. The levels of serum LOXL2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 49 RA-ILD patients (21 patients with ILD disease duration &lt; 3 months; 28 patients with ILD disease duration &gt; 3 months), 43 RA patients without ILD and 20 normal healthy controls. We assessed the correlations between the serum LOXL2 levels and clinical variables. Serum LOXL2 levels were significantly higher in RA patients than in normal healthy controls (326.79 ± 192.56 vs. 53.27 ± 35.86 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was present between the RA-ILD group and RA without ILD group (298.87 ± 219.85 vs. 358.60 ± 152.16 pg/ml, P = 0.13). Notably, the serum LOXL2 levels were significantly higher in patients with ILD disease duration &lt; 3 months than in those with ILD disease duration &gt; 3 months (462.71 ± 208.97 vs. 175.99 ± 130.55 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.01) or without ILD (462.71 ± 208.97 vs. 358.60 ± 152.16 pg/ml, P = 0.03). The serum LOXL2 levels in RA-ILD patients significantly correlated with DAS28 (rs = 0.31, P = 0.034), C-reactive protein (rs = 0.41, P = 0.004), rheumatoid factor (rs = 0.41, P = 0.003), forced vital capacity (rs = - 0.39, P = 0.02), and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (rs = - 0.44, P = 0.009). LOXL2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease and might be helpful in early diagnosis of RA-ILD.
Baseline sympathetic activity was found to be elevated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and it is related to increased cardiovascular risk in these patients. Although many studies have highlighted the association between RA and increased cardiac sympathetic activity, the underlying mechanistic links remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to understand how diseases-triggered changes in gene expression may result in maladaptive physiological changes. Our results suggest that the equilibrium between noradrenaline synthesis, release and reuptake was disrupted in the ventricles of arthritic rats. In the acute phase of the arthritic process, decreased gene expression of MAO-A might lead to accumulation of noradrenaline in myocardial interstitial space, whereas increased gene expression of NET protected cardiomyocytes from the deleterious effects of enhanced noradrenaline. During the chronic phase, reduced expression of β1-adrenoceptor and decreased efficiency of noradrenaline reuptake contribute to progressive damage of the myocardium and limits heart efficiency.
We aimed at investigating the effect of celecoxib (COX-2 selective inhibitor) and diclofenac (non-selective COX inhibitor) on endothelial function, and at identifying the underlying mechanisms in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA).
At the first signs of AIA, diclofenac (5 mg/kg twice a day, i.p), celecoxib (3 mg/kg/day, i.p) or saline (Vehicle) was administered for 3 weeks. Endothelial function was studied in aortic rings relaxed with acetylcholine (Ach) with or without inhibitors of NOS, arginase, EDHF and superoxide anions (O2-°) production. Aortic expression of eNOS, Ser1177-phospho-eNOS, COX-2, arginase-2, p22phox and p47phox was evaluated by Western blotting analysis. Arthritis scores, blood pressure, glycaemia and serum ADMA levels were measured.
Diclofenac and celecoxib significantly reduced arthritis score to the same extent (p&lt;0.05). As compared to vehicle-treated AIA, celecoxib did not change whereas diclofenac improved endothelial function (p&lt;0.05) through increased EDHF production, decreased arginase activity and expression, decreased superoxide anions production and expression of p22phox and p47phox. Diclofenac but not celecoxib significantly enhanced blood pressure and serum ADMA levels. Glycaemia was unchanged by both treatments.
Our study reveals that the effect of NSAIDs on endothelial function cannot be extrapolated from their impact on arthritis severity and suggest that changes in blood pressure and plasma ADMA levels may not be useful to predict CV risk of NSAIDs in RA.
To investigate the relationships of polymorphisms in genes whose protein products are related in the metabolic pathway of folic acid, particularly MTRR A66G, RFC1 G80A, and MTHFR C677T and A1298C, and disease activity in Mexican patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with methotrexate (MTX).
Sixty-eight patients with RA were included in the study who were being treated with MTX, either with or without other drugs. In addition to general data, disease activity was measured by the disease activity score 28 (DAS28). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Differences in genotype (homozygotic or heterozygotic for each allele), allele distributions, and phenotype were not statistically different between the RA group and control populations. We did not find any association between the studied polymorphisms and disease activity nor with the intragroup variables (e.g., clinical activity, body mass index, and single- or combined-drug treatment) or between genetic markers; we also did not find any association within the RA group or between the RA group and control populations.
Additional studies of more polymorphisms related to this or other metabolic pathways are required to determine the influence of genetics on disease activity in RA.
We evaluated the effect of six azoles on embryonic development in the rat whole embryo culture (WEC). Using the total morphological scoring system (TMS), we calculated the ID10 concentration (effective dose for 10% decrease in TMS). For evaluating gene specific responses, we combined previously and newly collected transcriptomics data of rat WEC exposed to a total of twelve azoles at their ID10 for 4h. Results revealed shared expressions responses in genes involved in the retinoic acid (RA) and sterol biosynthesis pathways, which are respectively representatives of developmental toxicity and targeted fungicidal action of the azoles. Azoles with more pronounced effects on the regulation of RA-associated genes were generally characterized as more potent embryotoxicants. Overall, compounds with strong sterol biosynthesis related responses and low RA related responses were considered as more favourable candidates, as they specifically regulated genes related to a desired target response. Among the identified sterol associated genes, we detected that methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (Msmo1) was more sensitively induced compared to Cyp51, a classical biomarker of this pathway. Therefore, we suggest that Msmo1 could be a better biomarker for screening the fungicidal value of azoles. In summary, we conclude that the embryonic regulation of RA and sterol metabolic pathways could be indicators for ranking azoles as embryotoxicants and determining their drug efficacy.
The two heterodinuclear nickel-ruthenium complexes [Ni(xbSmS)RuCp(PPh3)]PF6 and [Ni(xbSmSe)RuCp(PPh3)]PF6 (H2xbSmS = 1,2-bis(4-mercapto-3,3-dimethyl-2-thiabutyl)benzene, H2xbSmSe = 1,2,-bis(2-thiabutyl-3,3-dimethyl-4-selenol)benzene, Cp = cyclopentadienyl) were synthesized as biomimetic models of [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The X-ray structural analyses of the complexes show that the two NiRu complexes are isomorphous; in both NiRu complexes the nickel(ii) centers are coordinated in a square-planar environment with two thioether donor atoms and two thiolate or selenolate donors that are bridging to the ruthenium(ii) center. The Ru(ii) ion is further coordinated to a η5-cyclopentadienyl group and a triphenylphosphane ligand. These complexes catalyze hydrogen evolution in the presence of acetic acid in acetonitrile solution at around -2.20 V vs. Fc+/Fc with overpotentials of 810 and 830 mV, thus they can be regarded as functional models of the [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases.
The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation taken before or after exercise on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD).
Fifteen young men (aged 21.5±0.4 years) were given either BCAA (9.6 g·day-1) or placebo before and after exercise (and for 3 days prior to and following the exercise day) in three independent groups: the control group (placebo before and after exercise), the PRE group (BCAA before exercise and placebo after exercise), and the POST group (placebo before exercise and BCAA after exercise). Participants performed 30 repetitions of eccentric exercise with the non-dominant arm. DOMS, upper arm circumference (CIR), elbow range of motion (ROM), serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase, BCAA, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (3HMB) were measured immediately before and after the exercise and on the following 4 days.
Serum BCAA and 3HMB concentrations increased significantly in the PRE group immediately after the exercise, recovering to baseline over the following days. In the days following the exercise day, DOMS, CIR, and ROM were significantly improved in the PRE group compared to the control group, with weaker effects in the POST group. Serum activities of CK, LDH, and aldolase in the days following the exercise day were significantly suppressed in the PRE group compared to control group.
The present study confirmed that repeated BCAA supplementation before exercise had a more beneficial effect in attenuating DOMS and EIMD induced by eccentric exercise than repeated supplementation after exercise.
Camel milk (CM) has shown beneficial anti-inflammatory actions in several experimental and clinical settings. So far, its effect on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been previously explored. Thus, the current work aimed to evaluate the effects of CM in Adjuvant-induced arthritis and air pouch edema models in rats, which mimic human RA.
CM was administered at 10 ml/kg orally for 3 weeks starting on the day of Freund's adjuvant paw inoculation. The levels of TNF-α and IL-10 were measured by ELISA while the protein expression of NF-κBp65, COX-2 and iNOS was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of MAPK target proteins was assessed by Western blotting.
CM attenuated paw edema, arthritic index and gait score along with dorsal pouch inflammatory cell migration. CM lowered the TNF-α and augmented the anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels in sera and exudates of arthritic rats. It also attenuated the expression of activated NF-κBp65, COX-2 and iNOS in the lining of the dorsal pouch. Notably, CM inhibited the MAPK pathway signal transduction via lowering the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in rat hind paws. Additionally, CM administration lowered the lipid peroxide and nitric oxide levels and boosted glutathione and total anti-oxidant capacity in sera and exudates of animals.
The observed CM downregulation of the arthritic process may support the interest of CM consumption as an adjunct approach for the management of RA.
Retinoic acid (RA) is known to play a role in weight regulation. Because mice without ALDH1A1, a major RA synthesizing enzyme, are resistant to diet-induced obesity, we tested a hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of RA synthesis can suppress weight gain in a murine model of diet-induced obesity.
C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks to induce obesity and then randomized to a HFD with or without WIN 18,446, an RA synthesis inhibitor, for an additional 9 weeks. Body weight, body composition, energy expenditure, activity, and food intake were measured. Levels of retinoids, lipids, and genes involved in the metabolism of retinoid and lipids were also determined.
s Mice treated with WIN 18,446 gained significantly less weight and had decreased adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size, and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue. In addition, we observed higher UCP1 expression in adipose tissues and decreased expression of RA responsive genes and genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in the livers and lungs of mice treated with WIN 18,446.
Pharmacological suppression of RA synthesis via inhibition of ALDH1A1 may be a potential target for treatment of obesity.
To systematically review evidence regarding the relationship between circulating macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the association between MIF gene polymorphisms and RA susceptibility.
We performed a meta-analysis on data of serum/plasma MIF levels in patients with RA and in controls, and on associations between the MIF-173 C/G and -794CATT5-8 polymorphisms and RA susceptibility.
Twelve studies, comprising a total of 362 RA cases and 531 controls evaluated for MIF levels, and 2367 RA cases and 2395 controls evaluated for MIF polymorphisms, were included.
MIF levels were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (standardised mean difference (95% CI) 0.923 (0.766 to 1.080), p&lt;0.001). Stratification by ethnicity revealed significantly higher MIF levels in the RA group in Caucasian, Asian and Latin American populations. MIF levels were significantly higher in patients with RA, regardless of adjustment, sample size or data type evaluated. RA was identified to be significantly associated with the MIF-173 C allele (OR (95% CI) 1.271 (1.141 to 1.416), p&lt;0.001), as well as with the -794CATT7 allele (OR (95% CI) 1.229 (1.084 to 1.415), p=0.002) and the -794CATT7-MIF-173C haplotype RA (OR (95% CI) 1.433 (1.138 to 1.805), p=0.002).
Our meta-analyses revealed significantly higher circulating MIF levels in patients with RA, and found evidence of associations between the MIF-173 C/G and -794CATT5-8 polymorphisms and RA susceptibility.
Biological evaluation of hair growth/differentiation activity in vitro has been a formidable challenge, primarily due to the lack of relevant model cell systems. To solve this problem, we generated a stable model cell line in which successive differentiation via epidermal progenitors to hair components is easily inducible and traceable. Mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived cells were selected to stably express a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4) expression cassette and a luciferase reporter driven by a hair-specific keratin 31 gene (krt31) promoter (Tet-BMP4-KRT31-Luc iPS). While Tet- BMP4-KRT31-Luc iPS cells could be maintained as stable iPS cells, the cells differentiated to produce luciferase luminescence in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and doxycycline (Dox), and addition of a hair differentiation factor significantly increased luciferase fluorescence. Thus, this cell line may provide a reliable cell-based screening system to evaluate drug candidates for hair differentiation activity.
Nowadays, hydrogen (H2) production by green microalgae seems to be a very perspective, as stocks of water and solar energy are practically inexhaustible and renewable. The aim of this study was the optimization of conditions (organic carbon sources and lighting regime), which can provide light-dependent H2 production by green microalga Parachlorella kessleri RA-002 newly isolated in Armenia. The results indicated that carbon sources and lighting regimes affected H2 production. In the presence of used carbon sources H2 production was observed, but the highest yield of H2 was obtained in the presence of acetate. It was 2-fold higher than the H2 yield determined in the presence of glucose. The increase of H2 production might be connected with the stimulation of H2-producing enzyme - [Fe]-hydrogenase synthesis. The data obtained show that acetate can be used as an effective carbon source in H2 production. H2 production by microalga (in the presence of acetate and glucose) was enhanced by 1.5-2.5-fold in comparison with continuously illuminated algal cells, when P. kessleri was illuminated during 24h, and then was moved in the darkness. H2 yield increase is possible due to hydrogenase activation and the creation of anaerobic conditions. This study was significant to find out available effective substrates and optimal lighting regime to provide with light-dependent H2 production by microalgae.
Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by over-population and excessive activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts disrupting normal lung structure and functioning. Rosemary extract rich in carnosic acid (CA) and rosmarinic acid (RA) was reported to cure bleomycin-(BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrate that CA decreased human lung fibroblast (HLF) viability with IC50 value of 17.13±1.06 μM, while RA had no cytotoxic effect. In the presence of 50 μM of RA, dose-response for CA shifted to IC50 value of 11.70±1.46 μM, indicating synergic action. TGFβ-transformed HLF, rat lung fibroblasts and L929 cells presented similar sensitivity to CA and CA+RA (20μM+100μM, respectively) treatment. Rat alveolar epithelial cells died only under CA+RA treatment, while A549 cells were not affected. Annexin V staining and DNA quantification suggested that HLF are arrested in G0/G1 cell cycle phase and undergo apoptosis. CA caused sustained activation of phospho-Akt and phospho-p38 expression and inhibition of p21 protein.Addition of RA potentiated these effects, while RA added alone had no action.Only triple combination of inhibitors (MAPK-p38, pan-caspase, PI3K/Akt/autophagy) partially attenuated apoptosis; this suggests that cytotoxicity of CA+RA treatment has a complex mechanism involving several parallel signaling pathways. The in vivo antifibrotic effect of CA and RA was compared with that of Vitamine-E in BLM-induced fibrosis model in rats. We found comparable reduction in fibrosis score by CA, RA and CA+RA, attenuation of collagen deposition and normalization of oxidative stress markers. In conclusion, antifibrotic effect of CA+RA is due to synergistic pro-apoptotic action on lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.
The morphogen retinoic acid (RA) patterns vertebrate nervous systems and drives neurogenesis, but how these functions evolved remains elusive. Here, we show that RA signaling plays stage- and tissue-specific roles during the formation of neural cell populations with serotonin, dopamine, and GABA neurotransmitter phenotypes in amphioxus, a proxy for the ancestral chordate. Our data suggest that RA signaling restricts the specification of dopamine-containing cells in the ectoderm and of GABA neurons in the neural tube, probably by regulating Hox1 and Hox3 gene expression, respectively. The two Hox genes thus appear to serve distinct functions rather than to participate in a combinatorial Hox code. We were further able to correlate the RA signaling-dependent mispatterning of hindbrain GABA neurons with concomitant motor impairments. Taken together, these data provide new insights into how RA signaling and Hox genes contribute to nervous system as well as to motor control development in amphioxus and hence shed light on the evolution of these functions within vertebrates.
The aim of the study was to look for any association of MTR 2756A&gt;G and MTRR 66A&gt;G gene polymorphisms with clinical phenotype, methotrexate (MTX) treatment response, and MTX-induced adverse events in South Indian Tamil patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 335 patients with RA were investigated. MTR 2756A&gt;G gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP, and MTRR 66A&gt;G SNP was analyzed by TaqMan 5' nuclease assay. The allele frequencies were compared with HapMap groups. MTR 2756G allele was found to be associated with risk of developing RA. The allele frequencies of MTR 2756A&gt;G and MTRR 66A&gt;G SNPs in controls differed significantly when compared with HapMap groups. Neither of the SNPs influenced the MTX treatment outcome and adverse effects. Neither of the SNPs seems to be associated with MTX treatment outcome and adverse events in South Indian Tamil patients with RA.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used in human malignancies. Its long-term use cause neurobiological side effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prophylactic effect exerted by daily administration of ellagic acid (EA) and rosmarinic acid (RA) on DOX-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Our data showed that DOX-induced significant elevation of brain malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), caspase-3, and cholinesterase associated with significant reduction in reduced glutathione, monoamines namely serotonin, dopamine, as well as norepinephrine. Concomitant administration of EA (10 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 14 days) and/or RA (75 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 14 days) with DOX significantly mitigated the neural changes induced by DOX. Meanwhile, treatment ameliorated pro-inflammatory cytokines as TNF-α, iNOS, and attenuated oxidative stress biomarkers as well as brain monoamines. In conclusion, EA and RA can effectively protect against DOX-induced neurotoxicity, and the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect are potentially associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.
Malate synthase is a condensing enzyme responsible for conversion of glyoxylate to malate in the presence of acetyl-CoA. This reaction helps in bypassing the TCA cycle reactions involving carbon loss and leads to diverting some of the carbon skeletons to gluconeogenic events while rest can continue to provide TCA cycle intermediates. Malate synthase (GlcB) is encoded by MRA_1848 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb-Ra). We developed a knockdown (KD) Mtb-Ra strain by down-regulating GlcB. The survival studies suggested increased susceptibility to oxidative and nitrosative stress as well as to rifampicin. The susceptibility profile was reversed in the presence of free radical scavengers. Also, KD showed reduced biofilm maturation, failed to enter persistent state, and showed reduced growth inside macrophages. The study of post-endocytosis events showed differences in late stage endosomal maturation behavior in macrophages infected with KD compared to WT. Increased iNOS, LAMP1 and cathepsin D expression was observed in macrophages infected with KD compared to WT.
A tight regulation of neuron production is required to generate a functional cerebral cortex and is achieved by a proper balance between proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. Though the vitamin A (retinol) active derivative retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as one of the signals acting during mammalian forebrain neurogenesis, its function at the onset of neurogenesis as well as during establishment of cortical layers and neuronal subtypes remains elusive. One limitation is that murine mutants for genes encoding key enzymes involved in RA synthesis die during early embryonic development. We analysed corticogenesis in Rdh10 null mutants, in which an RA deficiency is generated as the intracellular retinol to retinaldehyde conversion is abolished. When analysed at the latest stage before lethality occurs (embryonic day [E]13.5), the mutants show smaller telencephalic vesicles and the thickness of their cortical plate is strongly reduced. The first progenitors formed in the cortical plate are radial glial (RG) cells which generate neurons either directly, or through an indirect mechanism involving the production of intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs) which then give rise to neurons. We show that in absence of RA, the RG progenitors proliferate less and prematurely produce neurons, leading to their depletion at E11.5. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that lack of RA impairs the generation of INPs at E13.5 and affects the cell cycle exit of progenitor cells during corticogenesis, altogether leading to a deficit in projection neurons and to microcephaly.
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder affecting the neurodevelopment, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal systems. CdLS is caused by mutations within NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8 genes. These genes codify for the "cohesin complex" playing a role in chromatid adhesion, DNA repair and gene expression regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway, a master developmental regulator, in CdLS cells.
Skin biopsies from CdLS patients and healthy controls were cultured and derived primary fibroblast cells were treated with RA or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle). After RA treatment, cells were harvested and RNA was isolated for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments.
We analyzed several components of RA metabolism in a human cell line of kidney fibroblasts (293T), in addition to fibroblasts collected from both NIPBL-mutated patients and healthy donors, with or without RA treatment. In all cases, ADH and RALDH1 gene expression was not affected by RA treatment, while CRABP1 was induced. CRABP2 was dramatically upregulated upon RA treatment in healthy donors but not in CdLS patients cells.
We investigated if CdLS alterations are associated to perturbation of RA signaling. Cells derived from CdLS patients do not respond to RA signaling as efficiently as healthy controls. RA pathway alterations suggest a possible underlying mechanism for several cellular and developmental abnormalities associated with cohesin function.

Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc finger transcription factor, has been implicated in the inflammation mediated by macrophages and endothelial cells by regulating the expression of inflammatory mediators. Here, we investigated whether KLF4 affects the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an important inflammatory mediator, in the human RA fibroblast-like synovial cell line MH7A. A pcDNA3.1-KLF4 plasmid or short interfering RNA KLF4 was transfected into MH7A cells, and the iNOS expression and nitric oxide (NO) production were analyzed by quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and nitrite measurement. The iNOS promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. The results showed overexpression of KLF4 increased iNOS expression and NO production in the presence or absence of TNF-α. Conversely, KLF4 knockdown markedly reduced iNOS expression and NO production induced by TNF-α. KLF4 activated the transcription activity of iNOS promoter in MH7A cells stimulated by TNF-α. This study indicates that KLF4 is important for regulating the expression of iNOS by TNF-α in human synoviocytes.
Coeloplanidae, the largest family of benthic ctenophores, comprises 33 species, all described based on traditional morphological characteristics, such as coloration, length, and number of aboral papillae, which are highly variable and can be affected by fixation methods and environmental conditions. Thus, there is a need for reliable genetic markers to complement the morphological identifications at the species level. Here, we analyzed 95 specimens from 11 morphologically distinct species of benthic ctenophores from the Red Sea and Sulu Sea, and tested selected regions of four genetic markers (ITS1, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and COI) for their ability to differentiate between species. We show that the barcoding region of the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), is highly variable among species of Coeloplanidae, and effectively discriminates between species in this family. The average Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) distance between species-level clades was 10%, while intraspecific variation was ~30 times lower (0.36%). COI-based phylogeny supported the delineation of four recently described new species from the Red Sea. The other nuclear markers tested were found to be too conserved in order to separate between species. We conclude that COI is a potential molecular barcode for the family Coeloplanidae and suggest to test it in pelagic ctenophores.
Natural products have gained considerable interests because of their use in some industrial areas including nutrition, cosmetic, pharmacy, and medicine. Salvia fruticosa M. (Lamiaceae) is known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative activities. Phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1, produce reactive metabolites which are eliminated by the action of phase II enzymes, NQO1, GPx, and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). In this study, in vitro modulatory effects of S. fruticosa and its major phenolic compound rosmarinic acid (RA) on CYP1A2, CYP2E1, NQO1, GPx, and GSTm1 mRNA expressions and enzyme activities of GPx and GSTs were investigated in HT-29 cells. An mRNA expression analysis revealed that CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 levels were decreased while those of NQO1, GPx, and GSTm1 increased after S. fruticosa and RA treatments. In parallel to gene expressions, enzyme activities of GPx and GSTs by S. fruticosa increased 1.68- and 1.48-fold, respectively. Moreover, RA increased GPx and GSTs activities 1.67- and 1.94-fold, respectively. The results of this preliminary study show that metabolism of xenobiotics may be altered due to changes in the expression and activity of the investigated enzymes by S. fruticosa.
The interaction between signaling pathways is a central question in the study of organogenesis. Using the developing murine tongue as a model, we uncovered unknown relationships between Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Genetic loss of SHH signaling leads to enhanced RA activity subsequent to loss of SHH-dependent expression of Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1. This causes a cell identity switch, prompting the epithelium of the tongue to form heterotopic minor salivary glands and to overproduce oversized taste buds. At developmental stages during which Wnt10b expression normally ceases and Shh becomes confined to taste bud cells, loss of SHH inputs causes the lingual epithelium to undergo an ectopic and anachronic expression of Shh and Wnt10b in the basal layer, specifying de novo taste placode induction. Surprisingly, in the absence of SHH signaling, lingual epithelial cells adopted a Merkel cell fate, but this was not caused by enhanced RA signaling. We show that RA promotes, whereas SHH, acting strictly within the lingual epithelium, inhibits taste placode and lingual gland formation by thwarting RA activity. These findings reveal key functions for SHH and RA in cell fate specification in the lingual epithelium and aid in deciphering the molecular mechanisms that assign cell identity.
Sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly heterogeneous disorder with only a few additive loci identified to date. We report a genotypic variability-based genome-wide association study (vGWAS) of six cohorts of sero-negative RA recruited in Europe and the US that were genotyped with the Immunochip. A two-stage approach was used: (1) a mixed model to partition dichotomous phenotypes into an additive component and non-additive residuals on the liability scale and (2) the Levene's test to assess equality of the residual variances across genotype groups. The vGWAS identified rs2852853 (P = 1.3e-08, DHCR7) and rs62389423 (P = 1.8e-05, near IRF4) in addition to two previously identified loci (HLA-DQB1 and ANKRD55), which were all statistically validated using cross validation. DHCR7 encodes an enzyme important in cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D and DHCR7 mutations are believed to be important for early humans to adapt to Northern Europe where residents have reduced ultraviolet-B exposure and tend to have light skin color. IRF4 is a key locus responsible for skin color, with a vitamin D receptor-binding interval. These vGWAS results together suggest that vitamin D deficiency is potentially causal of sero-negative RA and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder.
Alcohol is a severe hepatotoxicant that causes a variety of liver disorders. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural phenol, shows some biological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the effects of RA (10 mg/kg) against ethanol-induced oxidative damage and hepatotoxicity in rats. Animals received ethanol (4 g/kg, i.g.) and (or) RA (10 mg/kg, i.g.) daily for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, rats were weighed and use for biochemical, molecular, and histopathological examinations. Ethanol increased hepatic lipid peroxidation (P &lt; 0.001) and decreased hepatic levels of reduced glutathione (P &lt; 0.01), catalase (P &lt; 0.05), and superoxide dismutase (P &lt; 0.001) compared with control group. RA prevented the prooxidant and antioxidant imbalance induced by ethanol in liver. Furthermore, RA ameliorated the increased liver mass, serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, TNF-α, and IL-6 in ethanol group. Necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in liver parenchyma were attenuated by RA treatment. Our findings showed that RA prevents ethanol-induced oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and liver injury in an experimental model of ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Therefore, RA may be a good candidate to protect against ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity; this deserves consideration and further examination.
The elevated systemic levels of cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can change the expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters. Given that statins are lipid-lowering agents frequently used in RA patients with concurrent cardiovascular diseases, the objective of the present study was to investigate the impacts of RA on the pharmacokinetics of statins of different disposition properties in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters in tissues of CIA rats were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Statins were given to CIA rats and controls through different routes, respectively. Blood samples were collected and analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS. Isolated microsomes and hepatocytes were used to determine the metabolic and uptake clearance of statins. The results showed that, compared with controls, the mRNA levels of intestinal Cyp3a1 and hepatic Cyp2c6, Cyp2c7, Cyp3a1, Oatp1a1, Oatp1b2, Oatp1a4, and Mrp2 were markedly decreased in the CIA rats. The maximal metabolic activities of Cyp2c and Cyp3a were reduced in liver microsomes of CIA rats. When given orally or injected through hepatic portal vein, the systemic levels of fluvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, but not of rosuvastatin and pravastatin, were increased in CIA rats. The metabolic clearance of simvastatin and hepatic uptake clearance of fluvastatin and atorvastatin were decreased in CIA rats. These findings suggest that the changes in the expression of enzymes and/or transporters in CIA rats differentially affect the pharmacokinetics of statins.
Skeletal muscle weakness is a prominent feature in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we investigated whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training protects against skeletal muscle dysfunction in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). AIA was produced by intraarticular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the knees of Wistar rats. For NMES training, dorsiflexor muscles were stimulated via a surface electrode (0.5 ms pulse, 50 Hz, 2 s on/4 s off). NMES training was performed every other day for three weeks and consisted of three sets produced at three min intervals. In each set, the electrical current was set to achieve 60% of the initial maximum isometric torque and the current was progressively increased to maintain this torque; stimulation was stopped when the 60% torque could no longer be maintained. After the intervention period, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were excised and used for physiological and biochemical analyses. There was a reduction in specific force production (i.e. force per cross-sectional area) in AIA EDL muscles, which was accompanied by aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and desmin. Moreover, the protein expressions of the pro-oxidative enzymes NADPH oxidase, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, p62, and the ratio of the autophagosome marker LC3bII/LC3bI were increased in AIA EDL muscles. NMES training prevented all these AIA-induced alterations. The present data suggest that NMES training prevents AIA-induced skeletal muscle weakness presumably by counteracting the formation of actin and desmin aggregates. Thus, NMES training can be an effective treatment for muscle dysfunction in patients with RA.
We tested the hypothesis that estradiol (E2) protects against cardiorespiratory disorders and oxidative stress induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in adult female rats.
Sprague-Dawley female rats (230-250 g) were ovariectomized and implanted with osmotic pumps delivering vehicle or E2 (0.5 mg/kg/d). After 14 days of recovery, the rats were exposed to CIH (21%-10% O2: 8 h/d, 10 cycles per hour) or room air (RA). After 7 days of CIH or RA exposure, we measured arterial pressures (tail cuff), metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry), minute ventilation, the frequency of sighs and apneas at rest, and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (whole body plethysmography). We collected the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and adrenal glands to measure the activity of NADPH and xanthine oxidase (pro-oxidant enzymes), glutathione peroxidase, and the mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutase (antioxidant enzymes) and measured lipid peroxidation and advanced oxidation protein products (markers of oxidative stress).
CIH increased arterial pressure, the frequency of apnea at rest, and the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses and reduced metabolic rate. CIH also increased oxidant enzyme activities and decreased antioxidant activity in the cortex. E2 treatment reduced body weight and prevented the effects of CIH.
E2 prevents cardiorespiratory disorders and oxidative stress induced by CIH. These observations may help to better understand the underlying mechanisms linking menopause and occurrence of sleep apnea in women and highlight a potential advantage of hormone therapy.
