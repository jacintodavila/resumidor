In canaries, singing and a large number of morphological features of the neural system that mediates the learning, perception and production of song exhibit marked sex differences. Although these differences have been mainly attributed to sex-specific patterns of the action of testosterone and its metabolites, the mechanisms by which sex steroids regulate brain and behavior are far from being completely understood. Given that the density of immunoreactive catecholaminergic fibers that innervate telencephalic song nuclei in canaries is higher in males, which sing, than in females, which usually do not sing, we hypothesized that some of the effects induced by testosterone on song behavior are mediated through the action of the steroid on the catecholaminergic neurons which innervate the song control nuclei. Therefore, we investigated in female canaries the effects of a treatment with exogenous testosterone on song production, on the volume of song control nuclei, and on the catecholaminergic innervation of these nuclei as assessed by immunocytochemical visualization of tyrosine hydroxylase. Testosterone induced male-like singing in all females and increased by about 80% the volume of two telencephalic song control nuclei, the high vocal center (HVC) and the nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA). Testosterone also significantly increased the fractional area covered by tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive structures (fibers and varicosities) in most telencephalic song control nuclei (HVC, the lateral and medial parts of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum, the nucleus interfacialis, and to a lesser extent RA). By contrast, testosterone did not affect the catecholaminergic innervation of the telencephalic areas adjacent to HVC and RA. Together these data demonstrate that, in parallel to its effects on song behavior and on the morphology of the song control system, testosterone also regulates the catecholaminergic innervation of most telencephalic song control nuclei in canaries. The endocrine regulation of singing may thus involve the neuromodulatory action of specialized dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic projections onto several key parts of the song control system. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blockade provides substantive reduction of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While the biologic actions of TNFalpha have been well characterized in immune and synovial cells, which are known to be major contributors to the progression of cartilage destruction in RA, the current studies were designed to assess the direct effects of TNFalpha on chondrocytes. We examined the expression of several groupings of messenger RNA (mRNA) that define key biologic pathways that have previously been associated with either the general actions of TNFalpha or cartilage destruction, in murine articular chondrocytes isolated from wild-type mice and TNFalpha receptor-null (p55/p75(-/-)) mice. TNFalpha induced the expression of multiple mRNA that facilitate apoptosis and lead to apoptosis-induced cell death. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the increased expression of several factors involved in the regulation of skeletal tissue proteolysis and resorption. Quantitative increases from 2-fold to >10-fold were seen for inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase 3, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and osteoprotegerin mRNA expression. The dependence of the induction of these mRNA on TNFalpha was confirmed by comparison with the effects of TNFalpha on chondrocytes isolated from receptor-null mice. These findings demonstrate that TNFalpha alters the expression of a complex array of genes within murine chondrocytes that contribute to the destruction of joint surfaces, independent of its actions on synovial and immune cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic actions of TNFalpha in human cartilage cells. Membrane-associated prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) is a recently identified terminal enzyme of the arachidonic acid cascade, which converts PGH(2) to PGE(2) in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). This study was undertaken to investigate factors regulating the expression of mPGES. RASFs were treated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), indomethacin, NS-398, rofecoxib, or meloxicam. The effects of PGE(2) and selective agonists for PGE(2) receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) were also studied. Expression of mPGES messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was measured by Northern and Western blot analysis, respectively. EP receptor mRNA expression in RASFs was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Production of PGE(2) and cAMP was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The enhanced expression of mPGES mRNA and protein in IL-1beta-stimulated RASFs was attenuated by the addition of indomethacin, NS-398, rofecoxib, or meloxicam. This reduction of expression was reversed by PGE(2). IL-1beta-induced PGES activity, measured by conversion of PGH(2) to PGE(2), was decreased by rofecoxib. EP2 and EP4 receptor mRNA was detected in RASFs. EP2 and EP4 agonists, as well as PGE(2), restored the inhibitory effect of rofecoxib on mPGES expression. The effect of PGE(2) was mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cAMP was increased by IL-1beta and was inhibited by rofecoxib. Enhancement of mPGES expression by PGE(2) via the EP2/EP4 receptors with an increase in cAMP may play an important role in articular inflammation in patients with RA. It also seems that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors decrease PGE(2) production not only by direct inhibition of COX-2, but also by reducing mPGES expression in activated RASFs. The discovery of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has provided the rationale for the development of a new class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the selective COX-2 inhibitors (denominated coxibs), with the aim of reducing the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity associated with the administration of NSAIDs by virtue of COX-1 sparing. Rofecoxib and celecoxib are the first selective COX-2 inhibitors approved by the FDA and EMEA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and for relief of acute pain. Rofecoxib has been shown to spare COX-1 activity ex vivo, in platelets and gastric mucosa, when administered at therapeutic doses or above. In a large clinical trial, COX-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to halve the incidence of serious upper GI events vs a nonselective NSAID. Recently, other selective COX-2 inhibitors with different COX-1/COX-2 selectivity and pharmacokinetic features have been developed, i.e. valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumiracoxib. The improved biochemical selectivity of valdecoxib vs celecoxib in vitro (COX-1/COX-2 ratio: 60 vs 30, respectively) may be clinically relevant leading to an improved GI safety. Interestingly, parecoxib, a pro-drug of valdecoxib, is the only injectable coxib. Etoricoxib, showing only a slightly higher COX-2 selectivity than rofecoxib in vitro (COX-1/COX-2 ratio: 344 vs 272, respectively), has been reported to cause a similar specific COX-2 inhibition ex vivo that should translate into comparable GI safety. Lumiracoxib, the most selective COX-2 inhibitor in vitro (COX-1/COX-2 ratio: 400), is the only acidic coxib. It has been hypothesized that this pecular chemical feature may lead to an enhanced concentration in inflammatory sites that may translate into an improved clinical efficacy. The results of clinical trials have shown that coxibs have a comparable clinical efficacy and renal toxicity and an improved GI safety vs nonselective NSAIDs. Whether the different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics features of the various coxibs will produce detectable differences in efficacy and toxicity remains to be evaluated in appropriate comparative randomized clinical studies. Retinoids are potent regulators of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis and are important therapeutic agents in oncology and dermatology. The gene regulatory activity of endogenous retinoids is effected primarily by retinoic acid isomers (all-trans and 9-cis) that are synthesized from retinaldehyde precursors in a broad range of tissues and act as ligands for nuclear retinoic acid receptors. The catabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is an important mechanism of controlling RA levels in cell and tissues. We have previously identified two cytochrome P450s, P450RAI-1 and P450RAI-2 (herein named CYP26A1 and CYP26B1), which were shown to be responsible for catabolism of atRA both in the embryo and the adult. In this report, we describe the identification, molecular cloning, and substrate characterization of a third member of the CYP26 family, named CYP26C1. Transiently transfected cells expressing CYP26C1 convert atRA to polar water-soluble metabolites similar to those generated by CYP26A1 and -B1. Competition studies with all-trans, 13-cis, and 9-cis isomers of retinoic acid demonstrated that atRA was the preferred substrate for CYP26C1. Although CYP26C1 shares extensive sequence similarity with CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, its catalytic activity appears distinct from those of other CYP26 family members. Specifically, CYP26C1 can also recognize and metabolize 9-cis-RA and is much less sensitive than the other CYP26 family members to the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole. CYP26C1 is not widely expressed in the adult but is inducible by RA in HPK1a, transformed human keratinocyte cell lines. This third CYP26 member may play a specific role in catabolizing both all-trans and 9-cis isomers of RA. Nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression is proposed to be regulated by the ordered recruitment of large protein complexes in which activity depends on mutual interactions and posttranslational modifications. In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to mechanisms regulating the expression of the coregulator proteins themselves. Previously we have shown that the ligand-dependent corepressor, RIP140, is a direct transcriptional target of all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Here we demonstrate that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a rate-limiting step in the regulation of retinoic acid receptor signaling. Silencing of the RA induction of RIP140 dramatically enhances and accelerates retinoid receptor transactivation, endogenous expression of other RA target genes, and RA-induced neuronal differentiation and cell cycle arrest in human embryonal carcinoma cells. The data suggest that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a functional negative feedback loop that limits activation of retinoid receptors in the continued presence of RA and that acutely regulated expression of coregulators may be a general regulatory mechanism in hormonal signaling. This work represents the first step to set up a toxicity testing procedure and to evaluate the sensitivity of the test microorganism to several classes of environmental pollutants. First, three different techniques were employed to standardise the microbial inoculum, then two different toxicity assessment protocols have been compared: Microtox and a dehydrogenase (DHase) activity inhibition test. The main goal was the optimisation of a microbial bioassay based on the dehydrogenase activity (DHase) inhibition in Pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial strain ATCC 13525. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was used as electron acceptor and its reduction produces Triphenyl formazane (TPF). The P. fluorescens DHase inhibition bioassay was investigated for being a reliable and rapid method for assessing toxicity. The optimisation of the operating conditions resulted in a repeatable bioassay. Then, P. fluorescens and Vibrio fischeri sensitivity were firstly compared by testing Zn++, one of the reference compounds for Microtox test. In addition, other compounds (Ni++, Cd++, Cu++, phenol) were also tested with both bioassays. A high statistical significance of data was obtained with the logistic curve. The present work has demonstrated that P. fluorescens is as sensitive as Microtox culture (V. fischeri), for some of the metal ions. With reference to organic compounds, the lower sensitivity of P. fluorescens to phenol makes its use difficult in organic polluted samples. Establishment of anteroposterior (AP) polarity is one of the earliest decisions in cardiogenesis and plays an important role in the coupling between heart and blood vessels. Recent research implicated retinoic acid (RA) in the communication of AP polarity to the heart. We utilized embryo culture, in situ hybridization, morphometry, fate mapping and treatment with the RA pan-antagonist BMS493 to investigate the relationship between cardiac precursors and RA signalling. We describe two phases of AP signalling by RA, reflected in RALDH2 expression. The first phase (HH4-7) is characterized by increasing proximity between sino-atrial precursors and the lateral mesoderm expressing RALDH2. In this phase, RA signalling is consistent with diffusion of the morphogen from a large field rather than a single hot spot. The second phase (HH7-8) is characterized by progressive encircling of cardiac precursors by a field of RALDH2 originating from a dynamic and evolutionary-conserved caudorostral wave pattern in the lateral mesoderm. At this phase, cardiac AP patterning by RA is consistent with localized action of RA by regulated activation of the Raldh2 gene within an embryonic domain. Systemic treatment with BMS493 altered the cardiac fate map such that ventricular precursors were found in areas normally devoid of them. Topical application of BMS493 inhibited atrial differentiation in left anterior lateral mesoderm. Identification of the caudorostral wave of RALDH2 as the endogenous source of RA establishing cardiac AP fates provides a useful model to approach the mechanisms whereby the vertebrate embryo confers axial information on its organs. We have cloned a fragment of Cyp26B1, a novel retinoic acid (RA) catabolising enzyme, and examined its expression pattern during early stages of chick embryogenesis. It is expressed from stage 7 in the tail bud, an anterior patch of mesenchyme, the heart, the endothelium of the vasculature, the eye, the limb bud, the hindgut and in a complex pattern in the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. As such it has a non-overlapping expression with chick Cyp26A1, the other RA catabolising enzyme, but shows a combination of features of mouse Cyp26A1 and Cyp26B1. We have also examined its expression in the quail embryo and in the RA-free quail embryo. In the absence of RA, Cyp26B1 is only expressed in the hindbrain and fails to be expressed in all the other regions of the embryo, most dramatically in the trunk. Adding back RA rescues Cyp26B1 expression. Several etiological factors have been proposed as a cause for recurrent fetal abortions. Changes in blood coagulation during pregnancy may play an important role in the occurrence of recurrent abortions (RA). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of factor V Leiden, factor II prothrombin, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations in women with recurrent abortions (> or =2 abortions) in the German population. The mean number of abortions was 3 (range 2-8). Frequencies of the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin G20210A mutation were equally high in the patient group compared with our control group (for factor V Leiden: 11/101 vs. 9/122; p-value: 0.348; for prothrombin G20210A: 2/101 vs. 3/122; p-value: 0.81). Moreover, in both the patient and control groups, 15 of the women were homozygous for the MTHFR C677T allele (15/101 vs. 15/122; p-value: 0.635). The occurrence of FV Leiden, FII and MTHFR mutations was not significantly increased in the patient group compared with our control group. The results of the present study reveal no relationship between these common three thrombophilic mutations and recurrent abortions for the German population, and further studies are essentially recommended on whether a thrombophilia evaluation should be performed in patients with recurrent abortions. In mammalian peripheral nerves a crush lesion causes interactions between injured neurons, Schwann cells and haematogenous macrophages that can lead to successful axonal regeneration. We suggest that the transcriptional activator retinoic acid (RA), takes part in gene regulation after peripheral nerve injury and that RA signalling is activated via the cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP)-II and cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP)-I. With RT-PCR and immunoblotting all necessary components of the RA signalling pathway were detected in the sciatic nerve of adult rats. These are retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors, the retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes RALDH-1, RALDH-2, and RALDH-3, in addition, the cellular retinoid binding proteins CRBP-I, CRABP-I and CRABP-II. Enzyme activity of RALDH-2 was detectable in the nerve, and using a transgenic reporter mouse we found local activation of RA responsive elements in the regenerating nerve. Sciatic nerve crush as well as transection resulted in a more than 10-fold up-regulation of CRBP-I, which is thought to facilitate the synthesis of RA. Both kinds of injury also caused a 15-fold increase in transcript and protein concentration of CRABP-II, a possible mediator of RA transfer to its nuclear receptors. Previously we have shown that the expression of RA-A47 (rheumatoid arthritis-related antigen) which is identical to HSP47, a collagen-binding chaperon, is downregulated in chondrocytes by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). RA-A47 was also found on the surface of chondrocytes where it is recognized as an antigen in the serum of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Its translocation to the cell surface from endoplasmic reticulum membrane where it is normally located was also enhanced by TNFalpha. To understand the significance of RA-A47 downregulation in chondrocytes independent from other effects of TNFalpha, we used an antisense oligonucleotide approach and investigated the effect of this treatment on the expression of molecules related to matrix degradation and production of growth factors for chondrocytic, endothelial, and synovial cells. Here we show that treatment of rabbit chondrocyes and human chondrosarcoma cells HCS-2/8 by ra-a47 antisense S-oligonucleotides significantly reduced the expression of ra-a47 both at mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, this TNFalpha-independent RA-A47 downregulation was associated with a strong induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 mRNA and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA. The induction of active-type MMP-9 was further detected by gelatin zymography. Under the same conditions, the release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) from HCS-2/8 cells into the conditioned medium (CM) was strongly enhanced. These effects were not a result of TNFalpha upregulation, since the ra-a47 antisense oligonucleotide treatment did not enhance TNFalpha synthesis. These observations indicate that downregulation of RA-A47 induces TNFalpha-independent cartilage-degrading pathways involving iNOS and MMP-9. Furthermore, the stimulation of bFGF and CTGF release from chondrocytes may stimulate the proliferation of adjacent endothelial and/or synovial cells. The exploding progress in genomic technology and knowledge now opens the possibility to actually identify the molecular mechanisms in disease. However, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS), are complex and polygenic and remain a challenge. One possible shortcut could be the use of inbred animals as models for RA and MS for the genetic analysis. These models have been extensively characterized and show a similar degree of complexity as the corresponding human diseases. Using these models linkage analysis followed by isolation of the loci in congenic strains have been shown to be highly efficient and have provided fundamental new knowledge on the genetic control of these diseases. The genetically controlled congenic strains are also useful as scientific tools. They can be used for the identification of the disease-associated genes and, thereby, the essential disease pathways that have been selected by nature. We know that this is possible since we have succeeded in identifying the genes within two of the congenic regions; the MHC class II gene Aq controlling immune response and the Ncf1 gene controlling oxidative burst. Both of these genes are associated with T cell activation and arthritis severity. One general function for retinoic acid (RA) is pattern organization in the CNS. This regulatory factor has an essential role in spinal cord motor neuron and early posterior hindbrain development. In the anterior CNS, however, there is only a limited number of foci of RA synthesis, and less attention has been placed on regions such as the anterior hindbrain where RA synthesizing enzymes are absent. This study shows that a rich source of RA lies around the hindbrain from the RA synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (RALDH2) present in the surrounding meninges and mesenchyme by embryonic day 13. RALDH2 is not distributed uniformly throughout the meninges but is restricted to territories over the developing hindbrain, suggesting that RA signaling may be localized to those regions. Further regulation of RA signaling is provided by the presence of a RA sink in the form of the CYP26B1 RA catabolic enzyme expressed in deeper regions of the brain. As a guide to the neural anatomy of hindbrain RA signaling, we used a mouse transgenic for a lacZ reporter gene driven by a RA response element (RAREhsplacZ) to identify regions of RA signaling. This reporter mouse provides evidence that RA signaling in the hindbrain after embryonic day 13 occurs in the regions of the cerebellum and precerebellar system adjacent to sources of RA, including the inferior olive and the pontine nuclei. Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, is a crucial signaling molecule involved in tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. RA distribution and concentration is precisely regulated during embryogenesis by balanced complementary activities of RA synthesizing (RALDH) and metabolizing (CYP26) enzymes. Here, we describe the identification of a novel murine p450 cytochrome belonging to the CYP26 family, mCYP26C1. Sequence alignment show that mCYP26C1 is more closely related to mCYP26B1 than mCYP26A1. At early developmental stages (E8.0-E8.5), mCyp26C1 is expressed in prospective rhombomeres 2 and 4, in the first branchial arch and along the lateral surface mesenchyme adjacent to the rostral hindbrain. At E9.5, mCyp26C1 expression persists in rhombomere 2 and in the maxillary and mandibular components of the first branchial arch, and is strongly induced in the lateral cervical mesenchyme. By mid-gestation, mCyp26C1 is weakly expressed in the cervical mesenchyme and in the maxillary component of the first branchial arch. At E11.5, mCyp26C1 can only be seen in a narrow band in the lateral cervical mesenchyme. During late gestation, mCyp26C1 exhibits region-specific expression in the inner ear epithelium and a persistent expression in the inner dental epithelium of the developing teeth. This pattern of expression suggests that mCYP26C1 may play an important role in protecting the hindbrain, first branchial arch, otocyst and tooth buds against RA exposure during embryonic development. RPE65 is critical for the normal formation of 11-cis retinal and thus photoreceptor function. Opsin expressed in HEK293 cells has been reported to form rhodopsin on the addition of all-trans retinol, indicating that the machinery for retinoid isomerization is present. RPE65 has been previously identified in HEK293 cells at both the RNA and protein levels. To further understand retinoid metabolism in these cells and the control of RPE65 expression, HEK293 cells were used as a model to determine if retinoic acid (RA) affects RPE65 promoter activity. RPE65 levels were determined by Western blots. RA regulation of RPE65 promoter activity was monitored using the luciferase reporter assay after transient transfection of HEK293 cells with the RPE65 promoter. Deletion and truncation promoter mutants were assessed for activity. RA down-regulates RPE65 protein expression and promoter activity. The RA receptors (RARs), RARalpha, -beta, and -gamma, and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), RXRalpha, -beta, and -gamma, were all identified in these cells and shown to mediate the regulation of RPE65 mRNA expression. After deletion of the AP1, AP4 or NF1 transcription factor binding sites, the RA down-regulation was decreased, but the decrease was not associated with a single transcription factor. The truncation promoter constructs P60, P153 and P257 showed increases in promoter activity, indicating an inhibitory element had been removed, and the down-regulatory effect of RA was decreased. The down-regulation of RPE65 by RA is occurring at the transcription level. Multiple elements in the RPE65 promoter may contribute to this regulation. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 has been associated with inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its role in joint destruction remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect on cultured rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which play an important role in tissue degradation and angiogenesis in rheumatoid synovium. Treatment with nontoxic doses of celecoxib resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-1, -2, and -3 secretion from FLS when measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Celecoxib suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) induced augmentation of the gelatinolytic activity on zymography. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors might influence matrix degradation or angiogenesis in RA by downregulating the expression of various MMPs in rheumatoid FLS. Elevated free radical generation in inflamed joints and impaired antioxidant system have been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was performed to evaluate dietary nutrient intake and plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in RA patients. RA patients (n = 97) and their age, gender-matched controls (n = 97) participated in this cross-sectional case-control study. Nutrient intake was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Twenty subjects from each group provided blood samples, and plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and malondiadehyde (MDA) were measured. Also, plasma activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured. The mean calorie intake of RA patients was lower than that of the healthy controls. Energy-adjusted intake of fat, vitamin A and beta-carotene were significantly lower in patients than those of the control subjects. RA patients had a decreased mean plasma alpha-tocopherol level. The activity of plasma SOD and GPx in patients was significantly lower than that in control subjects. These results suggest proper antioxidant nutrient intake management may reduce free radical generation and improve antioxidant status in RA patients. The objective of the present study was to analyse salivary gland and free radical involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thirty-four consenting RA patients (rheumatoid factor-positive) and 18 healthy controls, matched in age and gender, participated in the study. Plasma and saliva samples were harvested and subjected to compositional analysis and various free radical-related tests. The mean salivary flow rate was lower in the RA patients than in the control group, whereas all plasma and salivary antioxidants were increased. Mean values of plasma malondialdehyde and ceruloplasmin were higher in the RA patients. The effects of RA on salivary gland flow rates and antioxidant compositional parameters may be of great importance for the further elucidation of the role of free radicals in RA pathogenesis and for its general diagnosis and evaluation. The demonstrated correlation between the altered salivary parameters and the severity of the disease may indicate that evaluation of the salivary status of RA patients is warranted. The stability of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is critically regulated by the Hdm2 and Hdmx proteins. Hdm2 protein levels are auto-regulated by the self-ubiquitination activity of Hdm2 and on the transcriptional level by p53-activated transcription of the hdm2 gene. Little is known about the regulation of Hdmx expression levels, apart from the observation that the Mdmx protein can be cleaved by caspase-3 in a p53-inducible manner. In the functional analysis of two mutant Hdmx proteins, products of two alternatively spliced mRNAs, it was found that Hdmx proteins are targets for ubiquitination by Mdm2. The stability of the Hdmx protein is partly dependent on the presence of its internal acidic domain. Mdm2 appears only to require an intact RING domain to be able to ubiquitinate Hdmx and target it for proteasomal degradation. These findings highlight the intricate functional relationships between p53, Mdm2, and Hdmx. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) is known to influence vitamin A homeostasis. In order to investigate the mechanism behind this retinoid disruption, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TCDD at doses ranging from 0.1 to 100 micro g/kg body weight, and were killed 3 days after exposure. Additional groups of rats were killed 1 and 28 days after a single oral dose of 10 micro g TCDD/kg body weight. Serum, kidney, and liver were investigated for retinoid levels, as well as gene expression and enzyme activities relevant for retinoid metabolism. Besides the well known effects of TCDD on apolar retinoids, i.e. decreased hepatic and increased renal retinyl ester (RE) levels, we have found dose-dependent elevation of all- trans-retinoic acid (all- trans-RA) levels in all investigated tissues. In the liver, 9- cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro-RA was drastically decreased by TCDD in a dose-dependent manner. In serum, cis-isomers of all- trans-RA, including 9,13-di- cis-RA, were significantly reduced already at the lowest dose level. Protein and mRNA levels of cellular retinol binding protein I (CRBP-I) in liver or kidneys were not significantly altered by TCDD exposure at doses at which retinoid levels were affected, making CRBP-I an unlikely candidate to account for the alterations in retinoid metabolism caused by TCDD. The expression and activities of relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with potential roles in all- trans-RA synthesis and/or degradation (CYP1A1, 1A2, and 2B1/2) were also monitored. A possible role of CYP1A1 in TCDD-induced all- trans-RA synthesis is suggested from the time-course relationship between CYP1A1 activity and all- trans-RA levels in liver and kidney. The significant alteration of the all- trans-RA metabolism has the potential to contribute significantly to the toxicity of TCDD. Vitamin A (retinol) is a nutrient that is essential for developmental regulation but toxic in large amounts. Previous genetic studies have revealed that alcohol dehydrogenase Adh1 is required for efficient clearance of excess retinol to prevent toxicity, thus demonstrating that the mechanism involves oxidation of excess retinol to retinoic acid (RA). Whereas Adh1 plays a dominant role in the first step of the clearance pathway (oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde), it is unknown what controls the second step (oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA). We now present genetic evidence that aldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh1a1, also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase Raldh1, plays a dominant role in the second step of retinol clearance in adult mice. Serum RA levels following a 50 mg/kg dose of retinol were reduced 72% in Raldh1-/- mice and 82% in Adh1-/- mice. This represented reductions in RA synthesis of 77-78% for each mutant after corrections for altered RA degradation in each. After retinol dosing, serum retinaldehyde was increased 2.5-fold in Raldh1-/- mice (indicating defective retinaldehyde clearance) and decreased 3-fold in Adh1-/- mice (indicating defective retinaldehyde synthesis). Serum retinol clearance following retinol administration was decreased 7% in Raldh1-/- mice and 69% in Adh1-/- mice. LD50 studies indicated a small increase in retinol toxicity in Raldh1-/- mice and a large increase in Adh1-/- mice. These observations demonstrate that Raldh1 functions downstream of Adh1 in the oxidative metabolism of excess retinol and that toxicity correlates primarily with accumulating retinol rather than retinaldehyde. Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins in monocytes/macrophages. The COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and may be involved in cellular homeostasis, whereas the COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that may play an important role in inflammation and mitogenesis. When U937 monocytic cells were incubated with retinoic acid (RA) for 48 h, cell differentiation took place with concomitant increases in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and COX activity. In this study, the mechanism of RA (all-trans- or 9-cis-RA)-induced enhancement of PGE2 biosynthesis in U937 cells was examined. Treatment of cells with all-trans- or 9-cis-RA up to 48 h caused an increase in PGE2 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Both RA isomers caused the enhancement of PGE2 production and the up-regulation of COX-1 expression at the protein and mRNA levels. The increase in COX-1 mRNA was found to precede the increase in COX-1 protein expression. Interestingly, the COX-2 protein and COX-2 mRNA were not detected in U937 cells, and their levels remained undetectable during the entire course of RA treatment. We conclude that treatment of U937 cells by RA for 48 h caused the initiation of cell differentiation, which was found to be concomitant with a significant increase in PGE2 production mediated via the up-regulation of COX-1 mRNA and protein expression. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (LPGDS; PGH(2)D-isomerase; EC 5.3.99.2) is a bifunctional protein first identified in the mammalian brain. It acts as a PGD(2)-producing enzyme and a retinoid transporter. Recent studies have shown that LPGDS is anomalously expressed in ovarian tumors and that retinoid may have a role as an ovarian cancer chemotherapeutic agent. To determine whether there is a relationship between retinoid and LPGDS in ovarian tumors, we examined the regulation of the gene encoding LPGDS by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that RA strongly induced the accumulation of LPGDS mRNA in human 3AO ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with RA induced the synthesis and secretion of LPGDS into the culture medium. This increased expression of LPGDS was accompanied by an inhibition of cell proliferation in the ovarian cancer cells. Prostaglandin D synthase, ovarian cancer, retinoic acid, real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Treatment of pseudoglandular stage fetal lungs in vitro with the pan-retinoic acid receptor (pan-RAR) antagonist, BMS493, reduces retinoic acid receptor beta (Rarb) gene expression within the proximal bronchial tubules and increases explant bud formation. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) increases Rarb expression and reduces explant bud formation through a signaling mechanism involving RARbeta. Together these data suggest that RA through RARbeta provides morphogenetic stabilizing activity to the proximal tubules during lung branching morphogenesis. Here we further investigate RA-mediated morphogenetic stabilization of the proximal respiratory tubules during fetal lung development. We demonstrate that Rarb isoform transcripts are the only known Rar transcripts to specifically localize to the proximal tubules and that RAREhsp68lacZ reporter transgene activity reveals endogenous RA signaling activity within these same proximal tubules. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the RA-producing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Raldh1), as well as of transforming growth factor-3beta (Tgfb3), Foxa2, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) within the proximal tubules are all altered by the application of either RA or BMS493 in vitro. We therefore discuss an interbud/proximal tubule signaling niche involving feedback between Rarb expression and Raldh1-mediated synthesis of RA. We suggest that this feedback favors interbud morphogenetic stability by increasing expression of morphoregulatory molecules such as TGFbeta3 and Foxa2, thus promoting bronchial tubule formation rather than continual budding and branching. The relationship between this RAR signaling center and the previously described distal bud signaling center is also addressed. To compare the efficacy and upper gastrointestinal (GI) safety of valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily with those of diclofenac 75 mg slow release (SR) twice daily in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Seven hundred and twenty-two patients with adult-onset RA were enrolled into this 26-week, randomized, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study (246 in the valdecoxib 20 mg daily arm, 237 in the valdecoxib 40 mg daily arm and 239 in the diclofenac 75 mg SR daily arm). Acetylsalicylic acid use (< or =325 mg per day) was similar across all groups: 5.4% in the diclofenac group, 5.7% in the valdecoxib 20 mg group and 5.9% in the valdecoxib 40 mg group. Efficacy was measured by the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain [visual analogue scale (VAS)] and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 26 of treatment, or at early termination. Upper GI safety was evaluated by endoscopy at the end of treatment, which took place no more than 2 days after the last dose of study medication or at early termination. Valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg daily were comparable to diclofenac 75 mg SR twice daily in treating the signs and symptoms of RA. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups with respect to mean changes from baseline in the Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (VAS) or mHAQ. The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg daily (6%) and valdecoxib 40 mg daily (4%) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in patients receiving diclofenac 75 mg SR twice daily (16%). Valdecoxib 20 mg daily was also associated with significantly improved GI tolerability (P = 0.035) compared with diclofenac. Single daily doses of valdecoxib 20 and 40 mg provided efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac, with a superior upper GI safety profile in the long-term treatment of RA patients. Endothelial dysfunction, defined as loss of bioactivity of NO in the vessel wall, is thought to precede atherosclerosis. To determine whether endothelial dysfunction characterises patients with RA and whether these patients have increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dependent NO production in vivo. and results: Twenty patients with RA and 33 normal subjects received intrabrachial artery infusions of endothelium dependent (acetylcholine (ACh)) and independent (sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) vasodilators to determine arterial responsiveness to NO. Basal flow and its percentage decrease by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of both iNOS and endothelium dependent NOS (eNOS), was used to determine the contribution of iNOS and eNOS dependent NO to basal flow. Both SNP (p<0.01) and ACh (p<0.05) increased blood flow significantly less in patients with RA than normal subjects. Serum concentrations of TNFalpha were, within the RA group, inversely correlated with blood flow responses to both SNP (r=-0.67, p=0.002) and ACh (r=-0.64, p<0.005). Basal flow was significantly increased in RA and correlated within this group with serum CRP (r=0.48, p<0.05), TNFalpha (r=0.61, p<0.01) concentrations, and ESR (r=0.68, p<0.002). L-NMMA decreased basal flow significantly more (-34+/-2%) in the patients with RA than the normal subjects (-24+/-3%, p<0.02), suggesting in view of the blunted response to ACh, increased iNOS activity. Patients with RA have a dual abnormality in NO dependent vascular function. Basal blood flow is increased in proportion to inflammatory activity and more inhibited by L-NMMA, suggesting increased iNOS activity, and responsiveness to NO is reduced. Three new arborinane-type triterpene glycosides, rubianosides II, III, and IV, a new arborinane-type triterpene, rubianol-g, and a new anthraquinone, rubianthraquinone, were isolated from a Chinese natural medicine, the roots of Rubia yunnanensis. The structures of the new constituents including their absolute configurations were determined on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. The inhibitory effects of the isolated constituents on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages were examined. Among them, a cyclic peptide constituent, RA-XII and its aglycon, RA-V (deoxybouvadin), potently inhibited overproduction of nitric oxide and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition, an anthraquinone constituent, 2-methyl-1,3,6-trihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone, was found to show inhibitory effects on the release of beta-hexosaminidase in RBL-2H3 cells. Genetic studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA) signaling is required for mouse retina development, controlled in part by an RA-generating aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by Aldh1a2 (Raldh2) expressed transiently in the optic vesicles. We examined the function of a related gene, Aldh1a1 (Raldh1), expressed throughout development in the dorsal retina. Raldh1(-/-) mice are viable and exhibit apparently normal retinal morphology despite a complete absence of Raldh1 protein in the dorsal neural retina. RA signaling in the optic cup, detected by using a RARE-lacZ transgene, is not significantly altered in Raldh1(-/-) embryos at embryonic day 10.5, possibly due to normal expression of Aldh1a3 (Raldh3) in dorsal retinal pigment epithelium and ventral neural retina. However, at E16.5 when Raldh3 is expressed ventrally but not dorsally, Raldh1(-/-) embryos lack RARE-lacZ expression in the dorsal retina and its retinocollicular axonal projections, whereas normal RARE-lacZ expression is detected in the ventral retina and its axonal projections. Retrograde labeling of adult Raldh1(-/-) retinal ganglion cells indicated that dorsal retinal axons project to the superior colliculus, and electroretinography revealed no defect of adult visual function, suggesting that dorsal RA signaling is unnecessary for retinal ganglion cell axonal outgrowth. We observed that RA synthesis in liver of Raldh1(-/-) mice was greatly reduced, thus showing that Raldh1 indeed participates in RA synthesis in vivo. Our findings suggest that RA signaling may be necessary only during early stages of retina development and that if RA synthesis is needed in dorsal retina, it is catalyzed by multiple enzymes, including Raldh1. Retinoids, a group of natural and synthetic analogues of vitamin A (retinol), modulate the differentiation of many cell types. Retinoids are also used for the prevention and treatment of cancer. The actions of retinoids are generally mediated by the retinoic acid receptors (RARs alpha, beta, and gamma) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs alpha, beta, and gamma). One of the RARs, RARbeta, is expressed at reduced levels in many human carcinomas, and F9 RARbeta(2)(-/-) cells do not growth arrest in response to RA. To determine if RARbeta(2) regulates the expression of a unique set of genes, through the use of subtractive hybridization and DNA array analysis, we have identified and characterized genes that are differentially expressed in F9 RARbeta(2)(-/-) teratocarcinoma cells. These genes, which encode transcription factors, cell surface signal transduction molecules, and metabolic enzymes, include c-myc, FOG1, GATA6, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase homologue (p28), Foxq1, Hic5, Meis1a, Dab2, midkine, and the PDGF-alpha receptor. These genes are regulated specifically by RARbeta(2) in F9 wild-type (Wt) cells as indicated by their expression profiles in F9 RARbeta(2)(-/-) cells as compared to F9 Wt, RARalpha(-/-), or RARgamma(-/-) cells, and their responsiveness to specific retinoid receptor agonists. The basal expression levels of some of these genes, such as c-myc, are higher in the F9 RARbeta(2)(-/-) cells than in F9 Wt in the absence of exogenous retinoids, suggesting that RARbeta(2) can inhibit gene expression in the absence of a ligand. The RARbeta(2) target genes are transcriptionally activated by retinol, as well as RA, in F9 Wt cells. Because the lack of RARbeta(2) alters both the control of proliferation and differentiation in F9 cells, the genes that we have characterized may mediate key effects of RA, via RARbeta(2), on these processes. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inhibitor of leukemia cell proliferation and induces differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. For RA to induce its biological effects in target cells, binding to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors is required. The resulting complexes bind to RA-responsive elements (RAREs) in the promoters of RA-inducible genes to initiate gene transcription and to generate protein products that mediate the biological effects of RA. In this report, we provide evidence that a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKC delta, is activated during RA treatment of the NB-4 and HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Such RA-dependent phosphorylation was also observed in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and resulted in activation of the kinase domain of PKC delta. In studies aimed at understanding the functional relevance of PKC delta in the induction of RA responses, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PKC delta (but not of other PKC isoforms) diminished RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. On the other hand, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the kinase strongly enhanced RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. Gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that PKC delta associated with retinoic acid receptor-alpha and was present in an RA-inducible protein complex that bound to RAREs. Pharmacological inhibition of PKC delta activity abrogated the induction of cell differentiation and growth inhibition of NB-4 blast cells, demonstrating that its function is required for such effects. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence that PKC delta is activated in an RA-dependent manner and plays a critical role in the generation of the biological effects of RA in malignant cells. Motor neurons are found throughout the developing chick hindbrain, while somatic motor (SM) neurons develop only in rhombomeres 5 to 8 (r5-8), and in r1. In r2-8 neuroepithelial explants from stage 7-10 embryos cultured in collagen gels, we found that motor neurons were generated throughout r2-8, while SM neuron differentiation was restricted to r5-8, as in vivo. Exposure of such explants to retinoic acid (RA) resulted in SM neuron differentiation throughout r2-8, while inclusion of the mesoderm and endoderm suppressed this effect. In explants with mesoderm/endoderm, RA-dependent SM neuron differentiation in rostral rhombomeres was restored by the application of an inhibitor of the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26. We found that the mesoderm/endoderm (either with or without RA) induced Cyp26 expression in the neuroepithelium in vitro, suggesting that the modulatory effect of CYP26 on RA-dependent patterning might be dependent on local signals. Spatially regulated synthesis and degradation of retinoic acid (RA) organize embryonic pattern formation in vertebrate embryos. Here, we show expression pattern of genes encoding Ciona intestinalis homologs of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, RALDH2, and the cytochrome P450 RA-degrading enzyme, CYP26, in normal and RA-treated embryos. The Ciona homolog of Raldh2, Ci-Raldh2, was expressed in a few muscle-lineage blastomeres in the middle gastrula. Strong expression was then restricted to the anterior-most three muscle cells on each side of the tailbud embryo. The Ciona homolog of Cyp26, Ci-Cyp26, was expressed in the presumptive brain cells in the middle gastrula. The expression was then upregulated in the neck region. The posterior end of the tail was also weakly stained. Non-overlapping expression domains of Ci-Raldh2 and Ci-Cyp26 look similar to those in vertebrates, although the expression of both genes was restricted to a small number of cells in Ciona embryos. RA upregulated Ci-Cyp26 expression and slightly downregulated Ci-Raldh2 expression in the tailbud embryo. We also show expression pattern of a Hox-1 ortholog (CiHox-1) in the Ciona embryo. CiHox-1 was expressed in two separated regions of the nerve cord and neck epidermis at the neurula stage. Expression pattern of these three genes are essentially similar to that in vertebrates. To investigate the effects of taurine chloramine (Tau-Cl), a chlorinated derivative of the amino acid taurine, on the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). FLS, isolated from the synovial tissue of RA patients, were treated in vitro with either interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; 1 ng/ml) alone or together with 200-500 microM Tau-Cl. The expression of COX isoenzymes was evaluated at both the protein (Western blotting) and the messenger RNA (mRNA) (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) levels. The concentration of PGE(2) was measured by competitive acetylcholinesterase enzyme immunoassay. Resting FLS expressed mRNA encoding both COX-1 and COX-2, but only COX-1 was present at the protein level. These cells produced negligible amounts of PGE(2). Upon stimulation with IL-1beta, elevation of COX-2, but not COX-1, mRNA and protein preceded the enhancement of PGE(2) synthesis. In the presence of 300-400 microM Tau-Cl, significant inhibition of IL-1beta-triggered COX-2 mRNA and protein, and a related decrease in PGE(2) production, was observed. In contrast, no significant changes in COX-1 mRNA and protein levels were noted. Tau-Cl inhibits IL-1beta-triggered elevation of COX-2 and generation of PGE(2) by RA FLS. These results expand the spectrum of known antiinflammatory activities of this compound. Antigen induces murine bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR), inflammation, mucus accumulation, and airway remodeling. To investigate whether leukotrienes (LT) mediate the effects of antigen [ovalbumin (Ova)], we studied 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) expression in immunized BP2 mice and blocked LT synthesis with the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton or antagonized their effects with receptor antagonists [cysteinyl leukotriene (Cys-LT)-ra MK-571, LY-171883; LTB4-ra PH-163]. Cys-LT content increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as early as 15 min after the intratracheal instillation of Ova. Zileuton inhibited LT release in the BALF and eosinophil recruitment in the lungs, and dose dependently reduced BHR, mucus accumulation, and remodeling, as did the LT-ra. Thus LT, released just after antigen challenge, might constitute the first step in accounting for the effects of Ova. Because mucus accumulation is regulated via the EGF receptor (EGFR), which is also implicated in the effects of LT, we studied this pathway with AG-1478, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor given at 0.5, 4, and 20 mg/kg. AG-1478 inhibited BHR, inflammation, and lung remodeling induced by Ova or by molecules themselves generated by Ova, such as LT, IL-13, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which promote identical effects, suggesting the involvement of the EGFR pathway in the asthma-like syndrome observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of action of a noninvasive remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) technique for the protection of multiple distant skeletal muscles against ischemic necrosis (infarction). It was observed in the pig that three cycles of 10-min occlusion and reperfusion in a hindlimb by tourniquet application reduced the infarction of latissimus dorsi (LD), gracilis (GC), and rectus abdominis (RA) muscle flaps by 55%, 60%, and 55%, respectively, compared with their corresponding control (n = 6, P < 0.01) when they were subsequently subjected to 4 h of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion. This infarct-protective effect of remote IPC in LD muscle flaps was abolished by an intravenous bolus injection of the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (3 mg/kg) 10 min before remote IPC and a continuous intravenous infusion (3 mg/kg) during remote IPC and by an intravenous bolus injection of the selective delta 1-opioid receptor antagonist 7-benzylidenealtrexone maleate (3 mg/kg). However, this infarct-protective effect of remote IPC was not affected by an intravenous bolus injection of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium chloride (20 mg/kg) or the nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (10 mg/kg) or by a local intra-arterial injection of the adenosine1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (3 mg/muscle flap) given 10 min before remote IPC. It was also observed that this remote IPC of skeletal muscle against infarction was associated with a slower rate of muscle ATP depletion during the 4 h of sustained ischemia and a reduced muscle neutrophilic myeloperoxidase activity after 1.5 h of reperfusion. These observations led us to speculate that noninvasive remote IPC by brief cycles of occlusion and reperfusion in a pig hindlimb is effective in global protection of skeletal muscle against infarction. This infarct-protective effect is most likely triggered by the activation of opioid receptors in the skeletal muscle, and remote IPC is associated with an energy-sparing effect during sustained ischemia and attenuation of neutrophil accumulation during reperfusion. Retinoic acid (RA) can transform the Golgi apparatus (GA) into a diffuse vacuolar aggregate and increase the toxicity of some immunotoxins that enter into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. An ultramorphological study of the RA-induced GA disruption was performed on F2000 fibroblasts. Cultures were treated with 0.11 to 30 microM RA for 7-180 min. The endocytosis of Limax flavus agglutinin-peroxidase conjugate (LFA), and the interactions between a phorbol ester (PMA) and RA concerning GA disruption, were examined. Exposure to 0.33 microM RA for 20 min transformed the GA into vacuolar aggregate. These vacuoles were not involved in endocytosis since they remained unstained after endocytosis of LFA. However, the lysosomes were involved in endocytosis, as they were strongly stained. Therefore, a RA-induced shift towards lysosomal routing of the entered LFA was presumed. Exposure to PMA made cells resistant to the Golgi-disturbing effects of RA, indicating that protein kinase C plays an important role in this process. The protective effects and roles of AT1-receptor antagonists (AT1-RA) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury during hypoxia are not entirely known. Therefore, we investigated these effects and mechanisms in human aortic (HA) EC. DNA fragmentation, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and caspase-3 activity were measured in cultured HAEC after exposure to hypoxia in the presence or absence of an AT1-RA (candesartan, CS) and/or an ACEI (temocaprilat, TC). Next, we investigated endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) and inducible (i) NOS to determine the role of the bradykinin(BK)-NO pathway in the protective effect on ACEI and AT1-RA in the setting of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Exposure to hypoxia increased DNA fragmentation in HAEC associated with the activation of caspase-3, but did not affect LDH release. In addition, hypoxia induced ecNOS mRNA but not mRNA iNOS. CS and/or TC reduced apoptosis induced by hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly increased BK and ecNOS expression. This effect was attenuated by the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140, and the NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NMMA). Hypoxia activates the pathway leading to apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 activity. Both CS and TC can ameliorate hypoxia-induced apoptosis in HAEC through inhibiting caspase-3 activation by enhancing ecNOS activity, via the accumulation of BK. Recent evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a mediator of angiogenesis, and COX-2 activity is known to be upregulated in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium. We examined whether mediation of angiogenesis by COX-2 was occuring in cells of the RA synovium and in microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) that are similar to those found in the RA synovium. We demonstrate that rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, acts directly on human dermal microvascular ECs (HMVECs) to inhibit their chemotactic and tube forming ability. Likewise, pretreatment of HMVECs with rofecoxib significantly inhibited their ability to form tubes induced by conditioned media (CM) of activated RA synovial fibroblasts. When RA synovial fibroblasts were pretreated with rofecoxib for 16 h and then stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta, their CM induced significantly less HMVEC tube formation when compared with CM from vehicle-treated RA synovial fibroblasts. ELISAs performed on activated RA fibroblast CM for known proangiogenic factors demonstrated a significant reduction in bFGF, in addition to the expected decrease in PGE(2). Our studies suggest that COX-2-induced angiogenic activity is an active mechanism within diseased synovium and may provide an additional rationale for the use of COX-2 inhibitors in RA. Leukotriene C(4) synthase (LTC(4) S) is a pivotal enzyme for generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysLTs). LTC(4) S activity in rat basophilic leukemia-1 (RBL-1) cells increased after culture in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) analogues, which was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D (ACD). Unexpectedly, the co-addition of a low dose of ACD with RA further potentiated the upregulation of the LTC(4) S activity. Daunorubicin and mitomycin C also had a similar effect. When stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, control cells did not produce cysLTs, but RA-treated cells generated cysLTs and the co-addition of ACD further increased. While LTC(4) S mRNA and protein increased in the cells treated with RA, the co-addition of ACD further potentiated both in proportion to the LTC(4) S activity. The effect of ACD was considered to enhance the transcription rate of LTC(4) S gene, but not the mRNA-stability. The addition of methylprednisolone (MP) inhibited generation of cysLTs from the cells with A23187-stimulation and also did LTC(4) S activity, but did not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). The suppression of LTC(4) S with MP showed a dependent manner on the time-point and duration of MP-treatment after RA-addition which was correlated with reduction in LTC(4) S mRNA and protein. The cells cultured with RA plus ACD contained more histamine, chymase activity, and granules in the cytoplasm than the control cells, suggesting differentiation to mature mast cells. In consideration of RA-differentiation therapy, it may be of pathophysiological relevance that the antineoplastic agents potentiate RA-induced, steroid-sensitive, induction of LTC(4) S in RBL-1 cells. The chicken anemia virus-derived protein Apoptin induces apoptosis specifically in human tumor and transformed cells and not in normal, untransformed cells. The cell killing activity correlates with a predominantly nuclear localization of Apoptin in tumor cells, whereas in normal cells, it is detected mainly in cytoplasmic structures. To explore the role of nuclear localization for Apoptin-induced cell death in tumor cells, we employed a mutagenesis strategy. First, we demonstrated that the C terminus of Apoptin contains a bipartite-type nuclear localization signal. Strikingly, further investigation showed that Apoptin contains two different domains that induce apoptosis independently, and for both domains, we found a strong correlation between localization and killing activity. Using inhibitors, we ruled out the involvement of de novo gene transcription and translation and further showed that Apoptin itself does not have any significant transcriptional repression activity, suggesting that Apoptin exerts its effects in the nucleus by some other method. To determine whether nuclear localization is sufficient to enable Apoptin to kill normal, untransformed cells, we expressed full-length Apoptin fused to a heterologous nuclear localization signal in these cells. However, despite its nuclear localization, no apoptosis was induced, which suggests that nuclear localization per se is not sufficient for Apoptin to become active. These studies increase our understanding of the molecular pathway of Apoptin and may also shed light on the mechanism of cellular transformation. Activation of CTL-mediated antitumor immunity to self-epitopes expressed by neoplastic cells is thought to be prevented, at any stage of tumor progression, by tolerance mechanisms. In contrast, in 74 American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IV melanoma patients, we found that development of lymph node metastases is a key event triggering CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immunity to self-epitopes encoded by melanocyte differentiation antigens. This was shown by the increased peripheral precursor frequency to Melan-A/Mart-1, gp100, and tyrosinase epitopes in stage III and IV compared with stage I and II patients, and by accumulation of functional memory T cells directed to Melan-A/Mart-1(26-35) in tumor-invaded lymph nodes. However, in tumor-invaded lymph nodes of most patients, CD8(+) T cells directed to melanocyte differentiation antigens or to tumor-restricted antigens (MAGE-3 and NY-ESO-1 epitopes), showed a CCR7(+) CD45RA(+) CD27(+) CD28(+) perforin(-) "precursor" phenotype. Only in 7 of 23 cases antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in invaded lymph nodes showed a predominant CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) CD27(+) CD28(-) perforin(+) "preterminally differentiated" phenotype. In the latter subset of patients, by immunohistochemistry in lymph node lesions, we found that CD8(+) T lymphocytes intermingling with the neoplastic tissue expressed a CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)/RA(-) phenotype, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes did not infiltrate the tumor. Furthermore, perforin and granzyme B were expressed on a higher fraction of the CD8(+) cells surrounding the invading tumor compared with the lymphocytes infiltrating the neoplastic tissue. In addition, no evidence for tumor regression was found in such metastatic lesions, as documented by absence of neoplastic cell necrosis or apoptosis. These data indicate that neoplastic cells in the lymph nodes and/or increased tumor burden in metastatic disease activate CD8(+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity to self-epitopes. However, the paucity of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells at tumor site suggests that immunotherapy strategies may require not only the boosting of tumor immunity, but also effective means to promote CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in the neoplastic tissue. We have successfully developed Fengshi Xiandan ([symbol: see text]) and used it to treat 53 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with indomethacin used to treat another 53 cases of RA as the controls. The results showed that the rate of cure and obvious effect was 54.7% and the total effective rate was 92.4% in the treatment group, as compared to 26.4% and 66.0% respectively in the control group, with an obvious difference in curative effect between the two groups (P < 0.01). The improvement of all the main clinical symptoms and signs except arthralgia in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The improvement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), C-reaction protein (CRP), immunoglobulin (Ig), T-lymphocyte subgroups, micro-circulation in nail fold, and red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) of anemia patients in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). There was an obvious difference (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in superoxide dismutase (SOD) of RBC and lipid peroxide (LPO) of plasma before treatment in the two groups as compared to normal group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The level of SOD and LPO after treatment in the treatment group obviously tended to normal as compared to that before treatment (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The reduction of LPO in the treatment group was obviously superior to that in the control group (P < 0.01). The result shows that Fengshi Xiandan ([symbol: see text]) with an obvious curative effect on RA can not only control the symptoms of RA but also improve its pathologic damage and prevent its development. To determine whether estrogen regulates retinoic acid (RA) production and signaling in the human endometrium as it does in the rodent uterus, we investigated the effects of estrogens on the expression of RA-metabolizing enzymes, retinoid receptors, and biomarker genes in the post- and premenopausal human endometrium. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) 2, a critical enzyme in RA biosynthesis, was induced 4-fold by estrogen replacement therapy with either Premarin or a mixture of estrone and equilin sulfates for 3 months. Estrogen replacement therapy also increased the expression of the RA receptor RAR alpha 1.9-fold. In parallel, there was a marked increase in the expression of two RA-regulated genes, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II and tissue transglutaminase. In the premenopausal endometrium, the levels of RALDH1, RALDH2, RAR alpha, and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II were increased in the estrogen-dominated proliferative phase, and the transcripts for the RA catabolic enzyme retinoic acid 4-hydroxylase (CYP26A1) and tissue transglutaminase were significantly increased in the secretory phase. Our results suggest that estrogen coordinately up-regulates RA production and signaling in the human endometrium. This coordinate mechanism may play a role in the antiproliferative effects that counterbalance the estrogen-induced endometrial proliferation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors have been shown to have comparable efficacy to nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Large outcome studies have shown that patients with OA and RA not taking low-dose aspirin have fewer symptomatic and complicated upper GI events when treated with COX-2 selective inhibitors than with nonselective NSAIDs. When used in recommended dosages, there is no convincing evidence that patients treated with COX-2 selective inhibitors have an increased incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including non-fatal myocardial infarction, than patients treated with either placebo or nonselective NSAIDs other than naproxen. Co-therapy with low-dose aspirin is recommended in patients with OA and RA at increased risk for cardiovascular events; the need for gastroprotective therapy in such patients is controversial. Because of Cyclooxygenase-2 selective non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the therapy of articular pain has become safer and more convenient. Currently, two highly Cyclooxygenase-2 selective drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, are available. Both are effective for patients with osteoarthritis (at daily dosages of 200 mg and 12.5 mg, respectively) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (at twice the above dosages). At higher daily dosages of 800 mg and 50 mg these substances still appear safe with regard to life-threatening gastrointestinal complications (perforation, obstruction, bleeding), if not given with concomitant aspirin. However, Cyclooxygenase-2 selective non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not confer protection against platelet aggregation and aspirin must be given where required for cardiovascular prophylaxis. Most patients will then routinely need gastroprotective agents such as proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol; it is unclear whether coxibs confer any benefit under such circumstances. Although not a coxib, Meloxicam does not appear to cause serious gastrointestinal complications if the low daily dosage of 7.5 mg is sufficient for the control of less pronounced pain and thus not exceeded. The gastrointestinal safety of nimesulide can not be sufficiently evaluated based on the available clinical data. Targeted inactivation of the mouse retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2/ALDH1a2), the enzyme responsible for early embryonic retinoic acid synthesis, is embryonic lethal because of defects in early heart morphogenesis. Transient maternal RA supplementation from E7.5 to (at least) E8.5 rescues most of these defects, but the supplemented Raldh2(-/-) mutants die prenatally, from a lack of septation of the heart outflow tract (Niederreither, K., Vermot, J., Messaddeq, N., Schuhbaur, B., Chambon, P. and DollÃ©, P. (2001). Development 128, 1019-1031). We have investigated the developmental basis for this defect, and found that the RA-supplemented Raldh2(-/-) embryos exhibit impaired development of their posterior (3rd-6th) branchial arch region. While the development of the first and second arches and their derivatives, as well as the formation of the first branchial pouch, appear to proceed normally, more posterior pharyngeal pouches fail to form and the pharyngeal endoderm develops a rudimentary, pouch-like structure. All derivatives of the posterior branchial arches are affected. These include the aortic arches, pouch-derived organs (thymus, parathyroid gland) and post-otic neural crest cells, which fail to establish segmental migratory pathways and are misrouted caudally. Patterning and axonal outgrowth of the posterior (9th-12th) cranial nerves is also altered. Vagal crest deficiency in Raldh2(-/-) mutants leads to agenesis of the enteric ganglia, a condition reminiscent of human Hirschprung's disease. In addition, we provide evidence that: (i) wildtype Raldh2 expression is restricted to the posteriormost pharyngeal mesoderm; (ii) endogenous RA response occurs in both the pharyngeal endoderm and mesoderm, and extends more rostrally than Raldh2 expression up to the 2nd arch; (iii) RA target genes (Hoxa1, Hoxb1) are downregulated in both the pharyngeal endoderm and mesoderm of mutant embryos. Thus, RALDH2 plays a crucial role in producing RA required for pharyngeal development, and RA is one of the diffusible mesodermal signals that pattern the pharyngeal endoderm. Variants of the copper-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) of Alcaligenes faecalis S6 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, by which the C-terminal histidine ligand (His145) of the Cu in the type-1 site was replaced by an alanine or a glycine. The type-1 sites in the NiR variants as isolated, are in the reduced form, but can be oxidized in the presence of external ligands, like (substituted) imidazoles and chloride. The reduction potential of the type-1 site of NiR-H145A reconstituted with imidazole amounts to 505 mV vs NHE (20 degrees C, pH 7, 10 mM imidazole), while for the native type-1 site it amounts to 260 mV. XRD data on crystals of the reduced and oxidized NiR-H145A variant show that in the reduced type-1 site the metal is 3-coordinated, but in the oxidized form takes up a ligand from the solution. With the fourth (exogenous) ligand in place the type-1 site is able to accept electrons at about the same rate as the wt NiR, but it is unable to pass the electron onto the type-2 site, leading to loss of enzymatic activity. It is argued that the uptake of an electron by the mutated type-1 site is accompanied by a loss of the exogenous ligand and a concomitant rise of the redox potential. This rise effectively traps the electron in the type-1 site. Many findings demonstrated that Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and Proteoglycans (PGs) possess antioxidant activity. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an experimental animal model similar to human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which free radicals are involved. Sodium salicylate can be used as a chemical trap for hydroxyl radicals (OH*), the most damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), yielding 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), (2,5-DHBA) and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA). The measurement of these two acids in the plasma allows to indirectly assess the production of OH* radicals. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of hyaluronic acid (HYA) (30 mg/kg i.p.) or chondroitin-4-sulphate (C4S) (30 mg/kg i.p.), on free radical production in Lewis rats subjected to CIA. After the immunization with bovine collagen type II in complete Freund's adjuvant, rats developed an erosive hind paw arthritis, that produced high plasma OH* levels assayed as 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, primed lipid peroxidation, evaluated by analyzing conjugated dienes (CD) in the articular cartilage; decreased the concentration of endogenous vitamin E (VE) and catalase (CA) in the joint cartilage; enhanced macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) serum levels and increased elastase (ELA) evaluated as an index of activated leukocyte polymophonuclear (PMNs) accumulation in the articular joints. The administration of HYA and C4S starting at the onset of arthritis (day 11) for 20 days, limited inflammation and the clinical signs in the knee and paw, reduced OH* production, decreased CD levels, partially restored the endogenous antioxidants VE and CA, reduced MIP-2 serum levels and limited PMNs infiltration. The results indicate that the GAGs HYA and C4S significantly reduce free radical production in CIA and could be used as a tool to investigate the role of antioxidants in RA. Retinoic acid (RA) is produced via two sequential reactions of retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) and retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs). We found that primary cultured mouse hepatocytes on a single collagen gel gradually lost hepatocyte specific morphology, and that another collagen gel overlay remarkably recovered it. The levels of albumin and liver-dominant expressed RDHs expression in hepatocytes paralleled their morphological change, decreased during single collagen gel culture, and were up-regulated by sequential collagen overlay. Quite similar to the expression changes, albumin and those RDHs' mRNA expression levels increased along with liver differentiation during pre- and postnatal liver development. Our data supports that all-trans and 9-cis RA, catalyzed by the RDHs, indeed play an important role in liver differentiation and regeneration. Methotrexate (MTX), widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and folate-dependent enzymes. Thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) are key enzymes in the folate metabolism and both have been shown to be polymorphic affecting the enzyme activity. To clarify the association between these genetic variations and MTX-related toxicity and efficacy in the treatment of RA, a total of 167 Japanese individuals with RA, including 52 and 63 patients treated with low-dose MTX with or without adverse effects, respectively, and 52 patients without MTX administration were analyzed. Among the 93 patients treated with MTX for >2 months, significantly more patients homozygous for the triple-repeat allele of the polymorphism in the promoter region of the TYMS gene required higher dose of MTX compared to those having at least a double-repeat allele (P=0.033). The incidence of > or =50% improvement in the serum CRP level was significantly higher in patients homozygous for the deletion allele of the polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the TYMS gene (P=0.0383). The allele frequency of the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the TYMS 3'UTR in Japanese was significantly different from that in Caucasians (P<0.0001), as was the tandem-repeat polymorphism in its promoter region. On the other hand, MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms showed no association with MTX-related toxicity or efficacy. Our results suggest that the genotyping for the TYMS polymorphisms may become a useful indicator in determining the appropriate dose of MTX in patients with RA. The germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF, NR6A1) is a nuclear orphan receptor that functions as a transcriptional repressor and is transiently expressed in mammalian carcinoma cells during retinoic acid (RA) induced neuronal differentiation. During Xenopus laevis development, the spatiotemporal expression pattern of embryonic GCNF (xEmGCNF) suggests a role in anteroposterior specification of the neuroectoderm. Here, we show that RA treatment of Xenopus embryos enhances xEmGCNF expression. Moreover, we present evidence for the relevance of this finding in the context of primary neurogenesis and hindbrain development. During early development of the central nervous system, RA signals promote posterior transformation of the neuroectoderm and increase the number of cells undergoing primary neurogenesis. Our loss-of-function analyses using a xEmGCNF-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotide indicate that xEmGCNF is required for the effect of RA on primary neurogenesis. This may be caused by transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26, since this gene is derepressed after depletion of xEmGCNF and an antimorph of xEmGCNF directly activates transcription of CYP26, also in absence of protein synthesis. The effect of xEmGCNF knockdown on hindbrain patterning is similar to conditions of reduced RA signaling, which may be caused by a reduction of RAR gamma expression specifically in the presumptive hindbrain. The etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear at present, but advances have been made in the drug therapy for RA. Recent attention has been focused on selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit a subtype of cyclooxygenase. Various clinical studies have confirmed that the selective COX-2 inhibitors cause fewer severe gastrointestinal complications, although an increased incidence of myocardial infarction was suggested. Terminal enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade, such as membrane-associated prostaglandin E synthase, might be a target for new NSAIDs in the near future. Low-dose glucocorticoid treatment for RA has been reconsidered possibly to prevent articular destruction of RA. Special attention for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis by concomitant administration of bisphosphonates might be necessary. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs should be effective in delaying the progression of joint destruction and physical disability. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide have shown such an effect. Inhibition of articular destruction was also proven by administration of the biologic agents etanercept and infliximab plus methotrexate. Tuberculosis complicated with infliximab therapy is one of the most important concerns in Japan. Agents that improve the quality of life of patients with RA are still needed. Interleukin (IL)-13 induces bronchopulmonary hyperreactivity (BHR), eosinophilic inflammation, and mucus accumulation in the murine airways. To investigate the potential role of leukotrienes (LT) in mediating these effects, we studied the ability of IL-13 to induce the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), we compared the effects of IL-13 and of various leukotrienes on different biological parameters and the interference by the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton (orally, 50 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 3 days), and by some antagonists. The cysteinyl (Cys)-LTs LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTB4, (1 microg/d for 3 d, instilled intratracheally) induced BHR, cell recruitment, fibroblast growth, and mucus production and release into the airways. After the intratracheal instillation of recombinant murine (rm) IL-13, Cys-LT increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 15 min, followed by lower amounts at 3-6 h. Zileuton inhibited LT production in the BALF, eosinophil and neutrophil sequestration in the lungs, and their passage into the BALF. Zileuton and the Cys-LT-receptor antagonist (ra) LY171883 or MK-571, or the LTB4-ra PH-163 (at 3-10, 5-15, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, administered intratracheally), inhibited BHR by recombinant murine IL-13. Airways mucus after recombinant murine IL-13-challenge was reduced by zileuton and by LY171883, MK-571, and PH-163. LT also induced the vascular endothelium remodelling and collagen deposition. Overall, our results demonstrate the major involvement of LT in the effects of IL-13 on the lung. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been implicated as mediators of osteoclastic bone resorption. Xanthine oxidase (XO) a ubiquitous enzyme is widely known for its production of these ROS. We therefore evaluated the potential of XO as a source of ROS in cytokine-and hormone-induced bone resorption. XO activity in rat calvarial osteoblasts was found to be significantly elevated upon stimulation by the cytokines, TNFalpha and IL-1beta. These cytokines also caused a dose related increase in bone resorption of mouse calvariae, which was significantly inhibited by catalase (10 IU/ml). Allopurinol, the competitive inhibitor of XO, also caused a dose related (1-50 microM) inhibition of TNFalpha (20 ng/ml) and (0.01-10 microM) IL-1beta (50 IU/ml)-induced bone resorption, respectively. PTH- and 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D3-induced bone resorption could also be inhibited by catalase (100 IU/ml) but was unaffected by allopurinol, indicating that another mediator, other than XO, is required for hormone-induced bone resorption. These results demonstrate, that modulation of the redox balance in the bone microenvironment, which contains XO, can affect the bone resorbing process. Therefore, XO may play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced bone resorption and, if manipulated appropriately, could show a therapeutic benefit in inflammatory bone disorders such as RA. Folate metabolism is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis through its involvement in both DNA methylation and nucleotide synthesis. A common Ala(222)/Val variant in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene leads to a disturbed folate metabolism and is associated with decreased genomic DNA methylation. We previously reported that the MTHFR Val/Val genotype was associated with increased cancer mortality in men from a population-based cohort of subjects ages > or = 85 years. To further explore the deleterious effects of the MTHFR genotype, we studied the association of the genotype with cancer risk in 860 men ages 65-84 years who were followed >10 years (Zutphen Elderly Study). During follow-up, 149 new cases of cancer occurred among the 793 men without cancer at baseline. The risk of developing cancer was 1.80-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.00) higher among men with the Val/Val genotype than among men with the Ala/Ala genotype. Except for lung cancer [relative risk (RR), 1.15], the risks of common forms of cancers were significantly increased among men with the Val/Val genotype [cancer of the prostate (RR, 3.48); the colorectum (RR, 3.65); the kidney and bladder (RR, 5.48)]. The risks of cancer were particularly increased among men with a lower folate and a higher alcohol intake and men of an older age. In conclusion, our current and previous studies in two independent populations indicate that a common Ala/Val variant in the MTHFR gene is a risk factor for cancer in elderly men from the general population. The mechanism underlying this association might involve genomic instability as a result of insufficient methylation of genomic DNA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while antioxidant enzymes, such as extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and catalase, block radical-induced events. The present study tested if the ex vivo transfer of EC-SOD and catalase genes alone or in combination in the knee joint of rats with monoarticular antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was anti-inflammatory, and examined the potential mechanisms involved. Synoviocytes isolated from female Wistar rats were immortalized with a retroviral vector SUV19.5. These cells were permanently transfected with an EC-SOD expression plasmid (pEC-SODZeo) or a catalase expression plasmid (pCatalaseZeo) to create cells overexpressing EC-SOD or catalase, as measured by RT-PCR and Western blots. The cells were engrafted in knee joints of animals at the time of the induction of AIA. Three gene transfer groups, an EC-SOD group, a catalase group and a combined therapy group (EC-SOD and catalase) were included in these experiments. Animals in the control group were engrafted with synoviocytes transfected with the plasmid pZeoSV2 without an insert. Clinical and histological assessments were performed, as well as tissue measurements of SOD, catalase and gelatinase activities. Ex vivo gene transfer of EC-SOD and catalase into rat knee joints produced about a six- to seven-fold increase in EC-SOD activity and a two- to three-fold increase in catalase activity compared with the control animals. Rats treated with cells overexpressing EC-SOD, catalase or a combination of EC-SOD and catalase showed significant suppression of knee joint swelling, decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells within the synovial membrane and reduced gelatinase activity in knee joints, compared with animals receiving cells transfected with the plasmid alone. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups treated with cells overexpressing EC-SOD, catalase or a combination of both. Gene therapy involving the local intra-articular overexpression of two antioxidant enzymes, EC-SOD and catalase, was anti-inflammatory in AIA. One mechanism appears to be the suppression of gelatinase activities by both EC-SOD and catalase. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to cause abnormalities in renal function. This is an important concern in patients with cardiorenal risk factors, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema, renal impairment, and advanced age. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis and ascertain whether these risk factors are associated with prescribing patterns of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors and other NSAIDs. This was a retrospective, longitudinal claims analysis using data from 19 large independent-practice-model managed care health plans in the United Stated. Three cohorts were identified based on claims for celecoxib, rofecoxib, or other NSAIDs from October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2000. Logistic regression models were used to explore whether baseline cardiorenal risk factors were related to choice of therapy. A total of 77,552 patients received celecoxib (n = 6779 [8.74%]), rofecoxib (n = 7189 [9.27%]), or other NSAIDs (n = 63,584 [81.99%]). Patients prescribed COX-2-selective inhibitors were older than those receiving other NSAIDs and had a diagnosis of RA more often. Overall, 42% of patients had >or=1 cardiorenal risk factor, and approximately one third had hypertension. Cardiorenal risk factors were not related to physicians' prescribing of celecoxib or rofecoxib, but the presence of any cardiorenal risk factor was associated with an increase in the use of COX-2-selective inhibitors compared with other NSAIDs, from 12% for cerebrovascular disease (point estimate, 1.124; P<0.001) to 74% for chronic renal failure/nephritis (point estimate, 1.738; P=0.025). RA and advanced age were associated with the use of celecoxib rather than rofecoxib. The prevalence of cardiorenal risk factors was found to be similar in patients prescribed celecoxib or rofecoxib for arthritis. Patients with these risk factors were more likely to receive a COX-2-selective inhibitor than other NSAIDs. To investigate the endogenous regulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine network in osteoarthritic (OA) and rheumatoid (RA) cartilage in relation to nitric oxide (NO) production. Cartilage specimen obtained from OA and RA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery were studied for iNOS expression, NO and IL-1 antagonist production in tissue culture. OA cartilage responded to IL-1beta-stimulation with higher NO production than RA cartilage, whereas there was no difference in NO synthesis between OA and RA samples when stimulated by TNFalpha or LPS. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) production was higher in RA cartilage than in OA cartilage, and its production was increased by NO synthase inhibitor 1400W. IL-1beta is a potent stimulator of NO production by the iNOS pathway in RA and more pronouncedly in OA cartilage. This process is regulated by cartilage derived IL-1 antagonists, and is implicated in cartilage destruction and synovial inflammation in OA and RA joints. Leflunomide and its active metabolite A77 1726 reversibly inhibits the enzyme dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase, the rate limiting step in de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and progression of the cell cycle in different cell lines, mainly activated T lymphocytes. To analyse in vitro the possible anti-inflammatory effects exerted by A77 1726, on cultured macrophages, obtained from the synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The effects of different doses of A77 1726 on intracytoplasmic expression and extracellular concentration of inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL6), as well as the influence on production and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) by primary cultures of synovial macrophages from patients with RA, were evaluated by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. The observations were made at four and 24 hours. A progressive and significant time and dose dependent decrease of the number of positive macrophages for intracellular TNFalpha and IL1beta, treated with different doses of A77 1726, was found in comparison with untreated cells. The extracellular concentration of TNFalpha was found to be significantly decreased in media containing cultured macrophages at 24 hours for all tested doses of A77 1726. At 24 hours, a significant time and dose dependent decrease of ICAM-1 and COX-2 expression by cultured macrophages after A77 1726 treatment was found. In conclusion, the mechanism of antiproliferative activity exerted by leflunomide on activated T lymphocytes seems to be the same mechanism (alteration of the cell cycle progression) which interferes with the functions of other activated cells-namely, the monocytes/macrophages, which are strongly involved in the inflammatory reaction in RA synovial tissue. The positive clinical results seem to confirm that leflunomide exerts an anti-inflammatory action on phagocytic cells in short and long term treatment of RA. In immune complex (IC) diseases, FcR are essential molecules facilitating polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) recruitment and effector functions at the IC site. Although FcR-dependent initial tethering and FcR/integrin-dependent PMN accumulation were postulated, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We here addressed potential mechanisms involved in PMN recruitment in acute IC glomerulonephritis (nephrotoxic nephritis). Since some renal cells may be recruited from bone marrow (BM) lineages, reconstitution studies with BM chimeras and PMN transfer between wild-type (WT) and FcR-deficient mice (gamma(-/-)) were performed. Severe glomerular damage was induced in WT and W gamma chimeras (BM from WT to irradiated gamma(-/-)), while it was absent in gamma(-/-) and gamma W chimeras (gamma(-/-) BM to WT). Moreover, WT PMN transfer, but not gamma(-/-) PMN, reconstituted the disease in gamma(-/-), indicating that FcR on resident cells is not a prerequisite for PMN recruitment in this disease. Surprisingly, transferred WT PMN were recruited coincidentally with NF-kappa B activation and TNF-alpha overexpression even in glomeruli with preformed IC (nephrotoxic Ab administered 3 days previously), suggesting that PMN can initially be recruited via its own FcR without previous chemoattractant release. Furthermore, H(2)O(2) inhibition by catalase attenuated the acute WT PMN recruitment and the induction of NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha much more than integrin (CD18) blockade, indicating a role for the respiratory burst before integrin-dependent accumulation. In coculture experiments with IC-stimulated PMN and glomeruli, PMN caused acute glomerular TNF-alpha expression predominantly via FcR-mediated H(2)O(2) production. In conclusion, glomerular IC, even preformed, can cause PMN recruitment and injury through PMN FcR-mediated respiratory burst during initial PMN tethering to IC. Among the three major POU proteins expressed in human skin, Oct-1, Tst-1/Oct-6, and Skn-1/Oct-11, only the latter induced SPRR2A, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. In this study, we have identified three Skn-1 isoforms, which encode proteins with various N termini, generated by alternative promoter usage. These isotypes showed distinct expression patterns in various skin samples, internal squamous epithelia, and cultured human keratinocytes. Skn-1a and Skn-1d1 bound the SPRR2A octamer site with comparable affinity and functioned as transcriptional activators. Skn-1d2 did not affect SPRR2A expression. Skn-1a, the largest protein, functionally cooperated with Ese-1/Elf-3, an epithelial-specific transcription factor, previously implicated in SPRR2A induction. This cooperativity, which depended on an N-terminal pointed-like domain in Skn-1a, was not found for Skn-1d1. Actually, Skn-1d1 counteracted the cooperativity between Skn-1a and Ese-1. Apparently, the human Skn-1 locus encodes multifunctional protein isotypes, subjected to biochemical cross-talk, which are likely to play a major role in the fine-tuning of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. To explore the effects of FK506 on the inhibition by triptolide (TP) of cell proliferation and expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and their inducing products PGE2, NO in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF), and to study the mechanisms of combination of FK506 and TP in RA therapy, RASF used in the experiments were obtained from synovial tissue of patients with RA and were cultured. RASF were pretreated with FK506(10-1000 nmol/L)for 2 h, then the cells were stimulated with TNF alpha(20 microg/L) in the presence or absence of TP (10 microg/L). The RASF proliferation was determined by [(3)H]-TdR incorporation, and the productions of PGE2 and NO in culture supernatants of RASF were detected with competitive ELISA and enzyme reduction of nitrate. Expression of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA in RASF were analyzed by semi quantitative RT-PCR. Expressions of COX-2 and iNOS protein were estimated by Western blot method and cellular enzyme immunoassay in synovial fibroblasts. NF-kappa B activity in whole-cell extract of RASF was also measured by an ELISA-based method. Results showed that neither FK506 nor TP at lower concentration (10 microg/L) alone affected TNF alpha-induced COX-2, iNOS expression and production of PGE2, NO in synovial cells. Combined treatment of FK506 and a lower concentration of TP (10 microg/L) down-regulated COX-2 and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, and their inducing products PGE2 and NO of synovial fibroblasts. This effect was positively correlated with FK506 concentrations (10-1000 nmol/L). NF-kappa B activity in TNF alpha-stimulated synovial cells was suppressed more profoundly by FK506 plus TP (10 microg/L) treatment than those with TP (10 microg/L) alone. No change was observed in inhibition of proliferation of synovial cells after combined treatment of FK506 and TP. In conclusion, FK506 enhanced TP-mediated down-regulation of COX-2, iNOS and their inducing products PGE2, NO in human RASF by suppressing the activity of NF-kappa B. Neuropoietic cytokines, which serve as mediators in neuroglial interactions, are differentially regulated after peripheral nerve injury. In Schwann cells, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) decreases. Pursuing the hypothesis that retinoic acid (RA) serves as a regulator of lesion-induced cytokine signaling we found that all RA receptors and retinoid X receptors are expressed in Schwann cell primary cultures. Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we have investigated the effect of RA on the expression of CNTF in these cells. After treatment with 10 nM all-trans RA for 22 h the concentration of CNTF mRNA was reduced to 63% of the control level, reminiscent of the regulation after nerve injury in vivo. In addition to CNTF, the mRNAs of leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor component alpha and gp130 were detected in the Schwann cells. The ability of vitamin A (retinol) to control growth and development depends upon tissue-specific metabolism of retinol to retinoic acid (RA). RA then functions as a ligand for retinoid receptor signaling. Mouse genetic studies support a role for cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) in the first step (oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde) and a role for cytosolic retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH) in the second step (oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA). Mice lacking ADH3 have reduced survival and a growth defect that can be rescued by dietary retinol supplementation, whereas the effect of a loss of ADH1 or ADH4 is noticed only in mice subjected to vitamin A excess or deficiency, respectively. Also, genetic deficiency of both ADH1 and ADH4 does not have additive effects, verifying separate roles for these enzymes in retinoid metabolism. As for the second step of RA synthesis, a null mutation of RALDH2 is embryonic lethal, eliminating most mesodermal RA synthesis, whereas loss of RALDH1 eliminates RA synthesis only in the embryonic dorsal retina with no obvious effect on development. Analysis of RA-rescued RALDH2 mutants has also revealed that RALDH3 and at least one additional enzyme produce RA tissue-specifically in embryos. Collectively, these genetic findings indicate that metabolism of retinol to retinaldehyde is not tissue-restricted as it is catalyzed by ubiquitously-expressed ADH3 (a low activity form) as well as by tissue-specifically expressed ADH1 and ADH4 (high activity forms). In contrast, further metabolism of retinaldehyde to RA is tissue-restricted as all enzymes identified are tissue-specific. An important concept to emerge is that selective expression of enzymes catalyzing the second step is what limits the tissues that can completely metabolize retinol to RA to initiate retinoid signaling. To investigate the role of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Taiwan, MnSOD and CYP1A1 genes polymorphisms were determined by he polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 112 patients with RA and 96 controls. There were no significant differences in the genotype, allele, and phenotype frequencies of MnSOD Ala-9Val (C1183T) polymorphisms between patients with RA and controls. The polymorphism of MnSOD 5777T, threonine at the 58th amino acid, cannot be found in RA patients and controls in Taiwan. The allele and phenotype frequencies of CYP1A1 4887A and genotype frequency of CYP1A1 4887C/A were lower in RA patients than in controls, whereas the significant difference was lost after correction. MnSOD C1183T polymorphisms were not associated with the clinical manifestations of RA. However, RA patients with CYP1A1 4889G/G have significantly higher frequency of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, especially in the presence of MnSOD 1183T/T. Patients with CYP1A1 4887C/A also have a trend to develop SjÃ¶gren's syndrome in the presence of MnSOD 1183T/T. The linkage disequilibrium between CYP1A1 4889G and CYP1A1 6235C can be found in this study. MnSOD gene polymorphisms are not related to susceptibility to RA in Taiwan, whereas individuals with CYP1A1 4887A tend to avoid the development of RA. Moreover, CYP1A1 4889G/G and 4887C/A may play a role in the development of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, especially in the presence of MnSOD 1183T/T. These findings are preliminary. A further confirmation study is necessary. We have previously reported that the retinoic acid (RA) catabolizing enzyme CYP26A1 plays an important role in protecting tail bud tissues from inappropriate exposure to RA generated in the adjacent trunk tissues by RALDH2, and that Cyp26a1-null animals exhibit spina bifida and caudal agenesis. We now show that, in the absence of Cyp26a1, retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) mediates ectopic RA-signaling in the tail bud. We also show that activated RARgamma results in downregulation of Wnt3a and Fgf8, which integrate highly conserved signaling pathways known for their role in specifying caudal morphogenesis. Ablation of the gene for RARgamma (Rarg) rescues Cyp26a1-null mutant animals from caudal regression and embryonic lethality, thus demonstrating that CYP26A1 suppresses the RA-mediated downregulation of WNT3A and FGF8 signaling pathways by eliminating ectopic RA in gastrulating tail bud mesoderm. Retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A, is involved in various developmental and homeostatic processes. To define whether certain developmental events are particularly sensitive to a decrease in embryonic RA levels, we generated mice bearing a hypomorphic allele of the RA-synthesizing enzyme Raldh2. The resulting mutant mice, which die perinatally, exhibit the features of the human DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) with heart outflow tract septation defects and anomalies of the aortic arch-derived head and neck arteries, laryngeal-tracheal cartilage defects, and thymus/parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia. Analysis of Raldh2 hypomorph embryos reveal selective defects of the posterior (third to sixth) branchial arches, including absence or hypoplasia of the corresponding aortic arches and pharyngeal pouches, and local down-regulation of RA-target genes. Thus, a decreased level of embryonic RA (through genetic and/or nutritional causes) could represent a major modifier of the expressivity of human 22q11del-associated DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndromes and, if severe enough, could on its own lead to the clinical features of the DiGeorge syndrome. The development of COX2 inhibitors with improved biochemical selectivity (such as etoricoxib and valdecoxib) over that of commercially available coxibs has been driven by the potential advantage of safety using higher coxib doses for increased efficacy. Etoricoxib has been approved in the UK as a once-daily medicine for symptomatic relief in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and acute gouty arthritis. It is currently approved with additional indications (i.e., for relief of acute pain associated with dental surgery, for primary dysmenorrhoea and for chronic musculo-skeletal pain, including chronic lower-back pain) in Mexico, Brazil and Peru. Etoricoxib has an in vitro COX1/COX2 IC(50) ratio of 344, the highest of any coxib. The administration of therapeutic doses of etoricoxib to healthy subjects does not affect COX1 activity in circulating platelets and gastric biopsies. The profound inhibition of monocyte COX2 activity at 24 h after dosing, as predicted by a pharmacological half-life of approximately 22 h, supports a once-daily dosing regimen of etoricoxib. In randomised, well-controlled clinical trials, etoricoxib has been shown to have a comparable clinical efficacy with traditional NSAIDs. Combined analysis of efficacy trials with etoricoxib versus non-selective NSAIDs has shown that the drug halves both investigator-reported upper gastrointestinal perforation, ulcers and bleeds (PUBs) and confirmed PUBs, and reduces the need for gastroprotective agents and gastrointestinal comedications by approximately 40%. The risk of lower extremity oedema and hypertension adverse experiences with etoricoxib was low and generally similar to comparator NSAIDs in a combined analysis of eight Phase III studies in OA, RA, chronic low-back pain and surveillance endoscopy. Large, randomised clinical trials have been planned to confirm the renal, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of etoricoxib. The hydrogen-uptake genes were transferred into wild Rhizobium arachis Ra strains (Hup-, Nif+, Apr) by triparental mating using pRK2013 as help plasmid. A transconjugant R. arachis Rz34-2(Hup+, Nif+, Apr, Tcr) which expressed high activities of hydrogenase and nitrogenase under free-living and symbiotic state was screened. Peanut inoculation test with recipient R. arachis Ra34, transcojugant Rz34-2 and control strain R. arachis L8-3 (Hup+, Nif+) was carried out respectively. The results showed that, compare to treatment without inoculation, inoculation with R. arachis Ra34 and R. arachis L8-3, the dry weight of leaf inoculated with transconjuant Rz34-2 increased 6.2%, 7.6% and 6.3% respectively; the N-content of seed increased 8.8%, 10.0% and 6.0%; the output increased 18.8%, 10.5% and 10.7%. This suggested that legume plants inoculated with Rhizobium strains (Hup+) were more efficient to accumulate N and to increase its output. Superoxide anion (O2(o)-)production by neutrophil NADPH oxidase participates in arthritic joint lesion formation. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have a priming effect on neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase activation is dependent on phosphorylation of p47phox, a cytosolic component of the enzyme. We studied O2(o)-production and p47phox phosphorylation in synovial fluid (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondylarthropathy (SpA) according to TNFalpha, IL-8 and GM-CSF levels. O2(o)-production by neutrophils isolated from SF of all the arthritis patients (RA and SpA) was higher than that of circulating resting neutrophils and when stimulated with fMLP or PMA. In addition, p47phox was partially phosphorylated in SF neutrophils compared to circulating neutrophils. High levels of TNFalpha and IL-8 (but not GM-CSF) are detected in patient's SF (compared to circulating blood levels). TNFalpha levels were significantly higher in RA than in SpA SF. These results suggest that increased NADPH oxidase activity could be involved in arthritic joint inflammation through increased p47phox phosphorylation. This could be the result of the presence of high levels of priming agents such as TNFalpha and IL-8 but not GM-CSF. The present study was undertaken to explore whether retinoids, which are known to have immunomodulatory actions, could attenuate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocytes incubated with TNF induced dose- and time-dependent accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium through the iNOS induction as confirmed by Western blotting. Treatment of cells with TNF in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) significantly decreased their ability to produce nitrite and iNOS induction. Both 13-cis- and all- trans-RA-induced suppression was dose-dependent, and all-trans-RA was somewhat potent than 13-cis-RA. The inhibitory effect of RA on TNF-induced iNOS induction was reversible, completely recovered after 2 days, and was exerted through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. TNF also suppressed the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. RA could not reverse the TNF- induced LPL suppression at RA levels causing near complete inhibition of the TNF-induced NO production. These results indicate that RAs attenuate iNOS expression reversibly in TNF-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and that the TNF-induced LPL suppression is not the result of NO overproduction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) are clinically effective against the inflammatory symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Recent attention has been focused on selective cyclooxygenase(COX)-2 inhibitors, a type of NSAID that inhibits a subtype of COX. Because of the different actions of COX-1 and COX-2, selective COX-2 inhibitors were expected to reduce adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal disorders. Various clinical studies have confirmed that the efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors for RA is similar to that of conventional NSAIDs, but they cause fewer severe gastrointestinal disorders. The incidence of complications related to renal dysfunction, such as edema and hypertension, is not different. Patients using selective COX-2 inhibitors have recently been reported to show an increase in thrombotic complications such as myocardial infarction. Therefore, more data on adverse events should be collected in the future from large-scale clinical studies to further clarify the actual value of selective COX-2 inhibitors. To investigate the effects of the active metabolite of leflunomide, A77 1726, on fibroblast-like synoviocytes. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocytes participate in tissue destruction by producing metalloproteinases (MMP), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and interleukin (IL) 6, which are involved in extracellular matrix degradation, resorption of the mineral phase and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Human synoviocytes were stimulated with IL-1alpha or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the presence of A77 1726. Culture supernatants were analysed for production of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), tissue-inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), PGE(2) and IL-6. Total RNA was isolated and analysed for steady-state levels of MMP-1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and IL-6 mRNA. A77 1726 inhibited the production of PGE(2) in synoviocytes activated by TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha with median inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 7 and 3 microM respectively. In contrast, MMP-1 and IL-6 production was inhibited at high A77 1726 concentrations (> 10 microM), whereas TIMP-1 was not affected. The inhibition of MMP-1 and IL-6 production was due to the known inhibitory effect of A77 1726 on pyrimidine synthesis, as it was reversed by the addition of uridine. This did not apply to PGE(2) production, which was inhibited via direct action of A77 1726 on COX-2, as shown by the increasing amount of substrate (arachidonic acid) in the culture medium. This study shows that some of the beneficial effect of leflunomide in RA patients may be due to the inhibition of PGE(2), IL-6 and MMP-1 production in synoviocytes. This effect, coupled with its multiple inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte functions, might account for the significant reduction in the rate of disease progression in RA patients treated with leflunomide. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in nearly every patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as part of a comprehensive management programme, but their use can be associated with side-effects. Low dose corticosteroid (<10 mg/day prednisone) in the treatment of RA is controversial. Although it is effective and possibly disease modifying, concerns exist about potential adverse events. We assessed costs and health effects of corticosteroids compared with NSAIDs and cyclo-oxgenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Markov (state transition) models were used to simulate a cohort of RA patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and either corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The regimens were assumed to be equally effective for the control of RA. Data on incidence, costs and consequences of adverse events from corticosteroids and from NSAIDs were taken from the literature. Costs were measured in 1999 US dollars; health effects expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed including best-case scenarios (0.5x adverse event rate) and worst-case scenarios (1.5x adverse event rate). In the base-case analysis corticosteroids were superior to NSAIDs. The sensitivity analyses of adverse event rate, using best-case and worst-case scenarios, and age showed that the results were sensitive to each combination of adverse event rate and age. In contrast, the sensitivity analyses of costs and utilities were robust. Using misoprostol or omeprazole prophylaxis with NSAIDs would make corticosteroids cost-effective. Compared with NSAIDs with COX-2 specific inhibition, corticosteroids were still cost-effective. Corticosteroids are more cost-effective than NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the long-term treatment of RA. To test the activity of elastase, collagenase and glutathione reductase in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in patients with osteoarthritis (OA); to correlate the elastase and collagenase activity with the glutathione reductase activity, which is important for the inactivation of oxygen free radicals. 24 patients affected by osteoarthrosis and 24 patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis took part in the study. We measured elastase activity towards the substrate metoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-p-nitroanilide (MeOSuc-ala-ala-proval-p-NA) which is highly specific for elastase, and insensitive to the other serine proteases, such as cathepsin G; collagenase activity was measured using [14C]-acetylated collagen as the substrate. Glutathione reductase activity was measured following the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) in the presence of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The concentrations of elastase, collagenase and glutathione reductase were statistically higher in patients with RA than in patients with OA. Moreover, in the SF of patients with RA we found positive correlation between enzyme activity levels. These results confirm a high activity of collagenase and elastase in the SF of patients with RA, which is about 30 times higher than that found in the SF of patients with OA. These data underline the synergic action of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of joint damage. RA patients also exhibit higher levels of glutathione reductase, which is important for the detoxification pathway of oxygen free radicals. However, compared with findings for collagenase and elastase, the increase in glutathione reductase is only three times higher than level found in the SF of OA patients. The limited increase in glutathione reductase activity during the inflammatory process might lead to an insufficient protective effect at the joint level in rheumatoid arthritis. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used to study the effects of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) on neuronal differentiation and acquisition of a catecholaminergic phenotype. SH-SY5Y cells express the intracellular factors activated through the receptors of the TGFbeta superfamily members, Smad1 and Smad4, as in basal conditions or after differentiation with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or retinoic acid (RA). TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 induce differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells by different pathways: the effect of TGF-beta1 is potentiated by TPA and the effect of BMP-2 is blocked by RA. Cell differentiation due to TGF-beta1 treatment is accompanied by an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, more pronounced in the presence of TPA or RA and counteracted by BMP-2. BMP-2 and RA both induce noncatecholaminergic cell differentiation, and together they may induce choline acetyltransferase expression in serum-cultured cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 may contribute, in opposite ways, to regulation of the neuronal catecholaminergic phenotype. Hereditary paragangliomas are rare benign tumours arising from neuroectodermal tissue in the head and neck region. In families with paraganglioma, occasionally adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas are found. Paragangliomas, adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas may be caused by mutations in the SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes encoding different subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II. Most paraganglioma cases in the Netherlands are caused by SDHD mutations. Presymptomatic DNA diagnosis is available for families with paragangliomas caused by SDHD mutations. The sexually dimorphic robust archistriatal nucleus (RA) represents the telencephalic output of the bird song system. Here, we document sex-dependent changes in both the metabolic and neuronal activity of RA during the sensory and sensorimotor phases of song learning. From posthatching day (PHD) 20-63 in males but not females, RA and its input nucleus HVc showed sharp increases in cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity relative to surrounding archistriatum and the underlying shelf, respectively. In urethane-anesthetized birds, during the same period, the spontaneous activity of male RA neurons underwent dramatic changes in firing rate, distribution of interspike intervals, and bursting frequency, compared with other archistriatal cells. At PHD 20-21, RA neurons had extremely slow, irregular firing rates in birds of both sexes. In males, from PHD 30-36, RA neurons increased their firing rates and spiking activity became more regular, and at approximately PHD 38, strong bursts followed by inhibition (which in awake animals is associated with singing) began to be observed. Dual recordings from RA and HVc revealed synchronous bursting, with RA spikes lagging approximately 10 msec behind HVc. We conclude that changes in relative CO activity correlate with changes in spontaneous firing rates within RA and that patterns of RA spontaneous activity exhibit gradual change as birds enter early song and then again for plastic song. The emergence of strong burst patterns in RA occurs later in life than does input from HVc as established by tracer studies or based on observed HVc bursting in young animals. Knockout of the murine retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) gene leads to early morphogenetic defects and embryonic lethality. Using a RA-responsive reporter transgene, we have looked for RA-generating activities in Raldh2-null mouse embryos and investigated whether these activities could be ascribed to the other known RALDH enzymes (RALDH1 and RALDH3). To this end, the early defects of Raldh2(-/-) embryos were rescued through maternal dietary RA supplementation under conditions that do not interfere with the activity of the reporter transgene in WT embryos. We show that RALDH2 is responsible for most of the patterns of reporter transgene activity in the spinal cord and trunk mesodermal derivatives. However, reporter transgene activity was selectively detected in Raldh2(-/-) embryos within the mesonephric area that expresses RALDH3 and in medial-ventral cells of the spinal cord and posterior hindbrain, up to the level of the fifth rhombomere. The craniofacial patterns of RA-reporter activity were unaltered in Raldh2(-/-) mutants. Although these patterns correlated with the presence of Raldh1 andor Raldh3 transcripts in eye, nasal, and inner ear epithelia, no such correlation was found within forebrain neuroepithelium. These data suggest the existence of additional RA-generating activities in the differentiating forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord, which, along with RALDH1 and RALDH3, may account for the development of Raldh2(-/-) mutants once these have been rescued for early lethality. This study was designed to investigate the effect of IL-1alpha-induced up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) secretion and the subsequent phenotypic effects of PGE(2) on epithelial cells. The effect of IL-1alpha on COX-2 expression was investigated in the T24 bladder epithelial cell line following treatment with 0, 0.05, 0.5, 1 or 10 ng/ml IL-1alpha for 1, 2, 4 or 6 h. Quantitative PCR confirmed up-regulation of expression of COX-2 with maximal expression observed following treatment with 0.5 ng/ml IL-1alpha for 1 h. Co-treatment of the cells with 0.5 ng/ml IL-1alpha in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) abolished the up-regulation in COX-2 expression confirming that the effect of IL-1alpha is mediated via its membrane-bound receptors. Treatment with 0.5 ng/ml IL-1alpha resulted in a time-dependent increase in PGE(2) secretion with maximal secretion detected at 24 and 48 h after stimulation with IL-1alpha. Co-treatment of the cells with IL-1alpha and IL-1RA or the COX-2 enzyme inhibitor NS398 abolished the IL-1alpha mediated secretion of PGE(2). Treatment of T24 cells with 100 nM PGE(2) resulted in a significant elevation in cAMP generation confirming the expression of functional PGE(2) receptors. Finally, the effect of exogenous treatment with PGE(2) on apoptosis of T24 cells was assessed using cell death detection ELISA. T24 cells were treated with camptothecin to induce apoptosis in the presence or absence of 50 or 100 nM PGE(2) or 10 microM forskolin. Treatment of T24 cells with increasing doses of camptothecin alone resulted in a significant increase in the induction of apoptosis (P<0.01). However, co-treatment of the cells with 50 or 100 nM PGE(2) or 10 microM forskolin resulted in the inhibition of induction of the apoptotic pathway by camptothecin. These data demonstrate that PGE(2) inhibits apoptosis of epithelial cells possibly via cAMP-dependent pathway. Taurine chloramine (TauCl), a product of neutrophil myeloperoxidase - halide system, formed by a reaction of taurine with HOCl, is known as an anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory long-lived oxidant. We previously reported that TauCl inhibits in vitro the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) by RA synoviocytes. Therefore we performed this study to investigate the effect of TauCl treatment on the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA1/J mice. Early administration of TauCl (after primary immunization) resulted in the delay of the onset of CIA, but had no effect on severity of arthritis. TauCl, given daily for 21 days after booster immunization, did not reduce the symptoms of arthritis in those mice, which already developed CIA, but significantly diminished incidence of the disease (55% vs. 90% of placebo mice). The mechanism of this effect is unknown. This is the first in vivo study suggesting that TauCl may be used for immune intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases. A combination of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and all-trans retinoic acid (IFN/RA) induces tumor cell apoptosis via some unknown mechanisms. Apoptosis is a gene-directed process that limits the proliferation of undesired cells. Several genes are required to regulate cell death in the higher-order animals. Earlier, we employed a gene expression knockout technique to isolate cell death-related genes. A novel gene, the gene associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19), was found to be essential for tumor cell death induced by IFN/RA. Here, we describe the development and characterization of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against GRIM-19. GRIM-19 is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Its expression is induced by the IFN/RA combination. We also show that GRIM-19 inhibits the cell-transforming property of viral oncogenic protein viral IFN regulatory factor-1 (vIRF-1) via a physical interaction. mAbs developed in this study should be useful for studying the other physiologic roles of GRIM-19 and serve as a potent tool for studying tumor responses to IFN/RA therapy. Retinoic acid (RA) affects development and function of the brain, but little is known about how much is made locally and where it is distributed. To identify RA-sensitive neural processes, we mapped the RA-synthesizing retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) during postnatal brain formation of the mouse. High and stable RALDH expressions mark the basal ganglia, olfactory bulbs, hippocampus and auditory afferents as major sites of RA actions in the functional brain. During the early postnatal period, transient and very high RALDH3 expressions distinguish two developmental events: (i) the colonization of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory bulbs by neuronal precursors and (ii) the maturation of selected parts of the cerebral cortex. In the cortex, RALDH3 is transiently activated in postmigratory layer II/III neurons during formation of their dendritic arbors and it is transported in their axons across the corpus callosum. RALDH3-expressing cortical regions include most of the limbic lobe, with strongest expression in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial and lateral secondary visual cortices, auditory cortical areas, the secondary motor cortex and some association areas. The transient cortical expression points to a brief RA-critical period during differentiation of the cortical network that serves in the coordination of sensory-motor activity with emotional and recently learned information. Retinal dehydrogenase type 1 (RALDH1) catalyzes the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A important for embryogenesis and tissue differentiation. Rat RALDH1 is expressed to high levels in developing kidney, and in stomach, intestine epithelia. To understand the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of rat RALDH1, we cloned a 1360-base pair (bp) 5'-flanking region of RALDH1 gene. Using luciferase reporter constructs transfected into HEK 293 and LLCPK (kidney-derived) cells, basal promoter activity was associated with sequences between -80 and +43. In this minimal promoter region, TATA and CCAAT cis-acting elements as well as SP1, AP1 and octamer (Oct)-binding sites were present. The CCAAT box and Oct-binding site, located between positions -72 and -68 and -56 and -49, respectively, were shown by deletion analysis and site-directed mutation to be critical for promoter activity. Nuclear extracts from kidney cells contain proteins specifically binding the Oct and CCAAT sequences, resulting in the formation of six complexes, while different patterns of complexes were observed with non-kidney cell extracts. Gel shift assays using either single or double mutations of the Oct and CCAAT sequences as well as super shift assays demonstrated single and double occupancy of these two sites by Oct-1 and CBF-A. In addition, unidentified proteins also bound the Oct motif specifically in the absence of CBF-A binding. These results demonstrate specific involvement of Oct and CCAAT-binding proteins in the regulation of RALDH1 gene. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition with benzolamide reduces proximal reabsorption and activates tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). In rats, TGF activation for 30 to 60 minutes locally suppresses renin secretion and resets TGF rightward to accommodate increased late proximal flow. After 24 hours of TGF activation, there is upward resetting of GFR and increased activity of macula densa nitric oxide synthase I (NOS I). We studied renal hemodynamics during early TGF resetting with attention to the importance of renin suppression and NOS I activation. Left kidney blood flow (RBF, pulse Doppler) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance or Fick method) were measured before and during benzolamide infusion (5 mg/kg bolus followed by 5 mg/kg/h IV) in Wistar rats concurrently receiving the converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat (0.3 mg/kg/h IV) or NOS-I blocker S-methyl-thiocitrulline (SMTC; 2.7 mg/kg/h IV). Activating TGF initially reduced RBF and GFR in all groups as expected. During continuous benzolamide, RBF gradually increased toward baseline in control and enalaprilat-treated rats, but not in NOS I-blocked rats. After the initial decline, GFR did not change further during one hour of benzolamide in any group. During one hour of persistent TGF stimulation, RBF increases toward normal, but GFR does not. This requires an overall decrease in renal vascular resistance and a decrease in the ratio of efferent/afferent arteriolar resistance (RE/RA), implying a major decrease in RE. NOS I, but not angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is required for RBF to increase during TGF resetting. Although the hemodynamic changes during TGF resetting resemble the response to blocking the renin-angiotensin system, these data fail to show that the increase in RBF during early TGF resetting is mediated by renin suppression. The sideroblastic anemias are characterized by ring sideroblasts, that is, red cell precursors with mitochondrial iron accumulation. We therefore studied the expression of mitochondrial ferritin (MtF) in these conditions. Erythroid cells from 13 patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and 3 patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) were analyzed for the distribution of cytoplasmic H ferritin (HF) and MtF using immunocytochemical methods. We also studied 11 healthy controls, 5 patients with refractory anemia without ring sideroblasts (RA), and 7 patients with RA with excess of blasts (RAEB). About one fourth of normal immature red cells, mostly proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for HF, but very few were positive for MtF (0%-10%). Similar patterns were found in anemic patients without ring sideroblasts. In contrast, many erythroblasts from patients with sideroblastic anemia (82%-90% in XLSA and 36%-84% in RARS) were positive for MtF, which regularly appeared as granules ringing the nucleus. Double immunocytochemical staining confirmed the different cellular distribution of HF and MtF. There was a highly significant relationship between the percentage of MtF(+) erythroblasts and that of ring sideroblasts (Spearman R = 0.90; P <.0001). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated the presence of MtF mRNA in circulating reticulocytes of 2 patients with XLSA but not in controls. These findings suggest that most of the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of MtF and that this latter might be a specific marker of sideroblastic anemia. Many anti-inflammatory agents are known to significantly enhance the terminal differentiation of some cancer cells such as leukemia cells. In this study, the effect of yomogin, a eudesmane sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Artemisia princeps with anti-inflammatory activity, was investigated in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Yomogin by itself induced small increases in cell differentiation, with less than 19 % of the cells attaining a differentiated phenotype. Importantly, yomogin synergistically enhanced differentiation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner when combined with either 5 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-(OH)(2) D(3)] or 50 nM all- trans retinoic acid (all- trans RA). Cytofluorometric analysis and morphologic studies indicated that the combinations of yomogin and 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) stimulated differentiation to monocytes whereas the combinations of yomogin and all- trans RA stimulated differentiation to granulocytes. These results suggest that yomogin may be useful in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) or all- trans-RA in the differentiation therapy for myeloid leukemias. Abbreviations. 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) :1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) FITC:fluorescein isothiocyanate NBT:nitroblue tetrazolium RA:retinoic acid PE:phytoerythrin The peroxidase activity of c-type cytochromes increases substantially by unfolding. This phenomenon was used to study the equilibrium unfolding of ferricytochrome c. The peroxidase activity is already enhanced at low denaturant concentrations. The lowest free energy folding intermediate is easily detected by this method, while it is invisible using fluorescence or optical spectroscopy. The free energy difference between this folding intermediate and the native state depends on the strength of the sixth ligand of the heme-iron and the increase in peroxidase activity upon unfolding is shown to be a sensitive indicator of the strength of this ligand. Under fully denaturing conditions, the peroxidase activity is inhibited by protein-based ligands. It is shown that at least three different ligand groups can be responsible for this inhibition, and that at neutral or alkaline pH, the predominant ligand is not histidine. The use of peroxidase activity assays as a method to study the unfolding of cytochrome c is evaluated. The IFN and retinoic acid (RA) combination suppresses cell growth by inducing apoptosis in the cultured tumor cells. Using a genetic technique, we have isolated several "genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality" (GRIM) that participate in this death pathway. One such gene, GRIM-12, encodes the redox enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TR). Antisense-mediated inhibition of TR abrogates cell death. To test the in vivo relevance of TR for growth suppression, we have conducted the following study. A wild-type TR or a catalytically defective mutant were expressed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and transplanted into athymic nude mice. These mice were treated with IFN-beta and all-trans RA combination. Tumors expressing the vector or wild-type TR were readily suppressed by the IFN/RA combination. In contrast, the tumors bearing a mutant TR were resistant to regression. We further show that markers of apoptosis are stimulated in the regressing tumors. These studies show a prominent role for TR in tumor-growth suppression. Retinoids play a crucial role in cellular differentiation and proliferation of epithelial tissue and their utility in oncology and dermatology is well documented. This mini review focuses on the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA or RA), the principal endogenous retinoid and its metabolism in cancer therapy. ATRA has been used successfully in differentiating therapy of acute promyelecytic leukemia and other types of cancers. However, its usefulness is limited by the rapid emergence of ATRA resistance due (in part) to ATRA - induced acceleration of ATRA metabolism. A novel strategy to subjugate the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been to modulate and/or increase the levels of endogenous ATRA by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzyme(s) responsible for ATRA metabolism. These inhibitors are also referred to as retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs). This review highlights development in the design, synthesis and evaluation of RAMBAs since 1987. Major emphasis is given to liarozole, the most studied and only RAMBA to undergo clinical investigation and also the recently developed novel and highly potent 4-azoly retinoids. The potential role of a new family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP26, with specificity towards ATRA is also discussed. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib 25 mg and 50 mg once daily versus placebo and naproxen 500 mg twice daily in patients with RA. Eligible patients were randomized (double-blind) to placebo (n = 289), rofecoxib 25 mg (n = 306), 50 mg (n = 286) once daily, or naproxen (n = 142) for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the ACR core set, with prespecified primary endpoints: patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity, tender and swollen joint counts. Investigator-reported adverse experiences, routine laboratory and vital sign measurements were monitored. Rofecoxib 25 mg, 50 mg, and naproxen provided similar treatment effects, significantly different from placebo, consistent with improvement, for all primary endpoints. Effects were evident at the earliest assessment (week 2) and sustained for 12 weeks. All treatments were generally well-tolerated. Rofecoxib 25 mg once daily had similar efficacy to naproxen 500 mg twice daily (a standard dose). No additional benefit was seen with 50 mg rofecoxib. We used transgenic reporter mice to determine whether brain regions that respond to retinoic acid (RA) during development do so in maturity. We focused on two prominent sites of embryonic RA signaling: the dorsal spinal cord and the olfactory bulb. In the mature dorsal spinal cord, expression of a direct repeat 5 RA response element (DR5-RARE) transgene is seen in interneurons in laminae I and II, as well as in ependymal cells around the central canal. In the olfactory bulb, DR5-RARE transgene-expressing neurons are seen in the mature granule cell and periglomerular layers, as well as in cells in the subventricular zone of the forebrain-the established source for newly generated granule and periglomerular neurons. In addition, there are transgene-labeled neurons in a small number of other brain regions. These include the spinal trigeminal nucleus, area postrema, habenula, amygdala, and the cerebral cortex. Thus, a distinct type of RA-mediated gene expression, detected with the DR5-RARE reporter transgene, defines neurons, subependymal, or ependymal cells in discrete locations throughout the neuraxis. Some of these cells--particularly those in the spinal cord and olfactory bulb--are found in central nervous system regions that receive local RA signals early in development, and retain a significant amount of functional or structural plasticity in the adult. Leptin, the hormone product of the ob gene, has recently been implicated as an important player in the complex hormonal control of fetal growth. Leptin actions are mediated via the long isoform of its receptor (Ob-Rb), while shorter isoforms may serve as transporters of leptin through physiological barriers (Ob-Ra) or as leptin-binding proteins in plasma (Ob-Re). Placental expression of these receptor isoforms could thus mediate leptin actions within the placenta or regulate transport of maternal, placental, and fetal leptin. In the present study, we show by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb, and Ob-Re mRNAs are dynamically expressed in the functionally distinct basal and labyrinth zones of the rat placenta during the period of maximal fetal growth (i.e., from Day 16 to Day 22 of pregnancy; term = Day 23). Western blot analyses confirmed placental expression of the Ob-Rb protein, and immunolocalization was most prominent in trophoblast and vascular tissues of the labyrinth zone. Ob-Ra and Ob-Re mRNA expression increased markedly (P < 0.01) from Day 16 to Day 22 in the labyrinth but not in the basal zone, whereas Ob-Rb mRNA and protein remained relatively stable. Because glucocorticoids inhibit feto-placental growth, placental leptin receptor (Ob-R) expression was also measured after manipulation of feto-placental glucocorticoid exposure. Maternal treatment with dexamethasone reduced (P < 0.05) placental expression of Ob-Rb mRNA and protein, whereas metyrapone (an inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis) stimulated (P < 0.01) placental expression of mRNAs encoding all three Ob-R isoforms. Dexamethasone and carbenoxolone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) also markedly reduced (P < 0.01) fetal but not maternal plasma leptin concentrations, consistent with inhibition of transplacental passage of maternal leptin. In conclusion, our data indicate that placental expression of Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb, and Ob-Re is likely to mediate leptin action and transport in the fetus and placenta. The effects of glucocorticoid manipulations on placental expression of these isoforms suggest that glucocorticoid-induced feto-placental growth retardation could be mediated, in part, via inhibition of leptin action or transport in the placenta. The aim of the study was to determine whether collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone (collagen-PVP) modifies some proinflammatory responses in synovium cultures from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Synovium from 10 RA patients were cultured with or without 1% collagen-PVP. Tissues on the 3rd, 5th and 7th culture day were sectioned and stained by the Herovici technique. Total collagen and type I/III collagen ratios were evaluated by the Woessner micromethod and by interrupted gel electrophoresis, respectively. Collagenolytic activity was assessed by degradation of [3H]-collagen in supernatants. TIMP-1, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were determined in supernatants by ELISA, and the results were normalized by DNA concentration. IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, TIMP-1, Cox-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and Fas/APO95 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL technique. The histological analysis and electrophoresis revealed a 1.7-fold increase of type III collagen in a time-dependent fashion in collagen-PVP-treated cultures. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta: 58 +/- 9 versus 22 +/- 10; TNF-alpha: 41 +/- 6 versus 11 +/- 3; IL-8: 59 +/- 12 versus 29 +/- 9; treated versus untreated), adhesion molecule (ICAM-1: 57 +/- 11 versus 29 +/- 15; VCAM-1: 49 +/- 7 versus 21 +/- 13; treated versus untreated) as well as Cox-1 (59 +/- 10 versus 20 +/- 3) expression was down-regulated in RA synovium treated. Meanwhile, TIMP-1 (36 +/- 7 versus 57 +/- 11) and Fas expression (20 +/- 10 versus 55 +/- 13) and apoptosis (14 +/- 3 versus 55 +/- 5) were up-regulated in treated cultures compared with controls. In supernatants, the collagenolytic activity, as well as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, levels were all down-regulated in treated cultures (two, three, fourfold, respectively). The addition of collagen-PVP to synovium-induced down-modulation of some inflammatory parameters and an increase in apoptosis of synovial cells. Perhaps this mechanism could contribute to inhibit outgrowth of pannus formation and to down-regulate inflammation of joints in patients with RA. Members of the Caudal-related homeobox gene family are implicated in anteroposterior (AP) patterning and posterior axis elongation in mammals. Previously, we found that Caudal-related homeobox gene1 (Cdx1) is directly regulated by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and we identified Wnt/beta-catenin responsive elements in the Cdx1 promoter. Here, we have generated a series of transgenic mouse lines to determine if the Cdx1 promoter region (-3.6 kb to -0.7 kb) sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in the normal Cdx1 expression domains. A 0.7-kb Cdx1 upstream regulatory sequence is sufficient to give the early phase of Cdx1 expression in the primitive streak. However, none of the reporter constructs was able to drive expression in the definitive endoderm at later stages of development. More detailed analysis of the cis-regulatory elements of this 0.7-kb Cdx1 promoter region revealed that two Wnt/beta-catenin responsive elements are important for initiation of Cdx1 expression in the primitive streak and one retinoic acid response element for maintenance. Our analysis demonstrates that the early Cdx1 expression is regulated through the caudalizing Wnt/beta-catenin and RA activities. This study examined vascular function and the role of superoxide in mice that chronically express human renin (R+) and human angiotensinogen (A+). Responses of aortas from R+/A+ mice and from their normotensive littermates (RA- mice) were examined in vitro. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired in vessels from R+/A+ mice (e.g., maximal relaxation to 100 microM acetylcholine was 45 +/- 5% and 65 +/- 3% in R+/A+ and RA- mice, respectively; P < 0.05). Relaxation was also impaired to the endothelium-independent dilators authentic nitric oxide and nitroprusside in vessels from R+/A+ mice. Maximal vasorelaxation to the endothelium-independent, non-nitric oxide dilator papaverine was similar in R+/A+ and RA- mice. Incubation of vessels from R+/A+ mice with Tiron (1 mM), a superoxide scavenger, improved relaxation to acetylcholine, nitric oxide, and nitroprusside. In contrast, incubation with diethyldithiocarbamate (1 mM), an inhibitor of copper-containing SODs, reduced acetylcholine- and nitroprusside-induced relaxation in vessels from both R+/A+ and RA- mice. Basal superoxide levels, measured with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (5 microM lucigenin) and hydroethidine-based fluorescent confocal microscopy, were higher in vessels from R+/A+ mice and were Tiron and polyethylene glycol-SOD sensitive. These results suggest that increased superoxide contributes to impaired nitric oxide-mediated relaxation in this genetic model of chronic angiotensin II-dependent hypertension. Recently, microsomal prostaglandin (PG) E synthase (mPGES) was cloned as a terminal enzyme catalyzing PGH2 to PGE2. We investigated mPGES as well as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, catalyzing arachidonic acid to PGH2, in synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The effect of dexamethasone on mPGES expression was also studied. Synovial cells were treated with interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and dexamethasone under various conditions, and expression of mPGES mRNA and protein was analyzed by Northern blot and Western blot, respectively. Conversions of arachidonic acid or PGH2 to PGE2 were measured by ELISA. Subcellular localization of mPGES and COX-2 was determined by immunofluorescent microscopic analysis. mPGES mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by IL-1beta in synovial cells. COX-2 mRNA and protein were also upregulated by IL-1beta, but with a different time course from that of mPGES. Conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 increased by IL-1beta and was correlated with mPGES expression. Increased conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2 was maintained when mPGES and COX-2 were coexpressed. Subcellular localization of mPGES and COX-2 overlapped in the perinuclear region in IL-1beta stimulated synovial cells. Dexamethasone inhibited mRNA and protein expression for mPGES and increased conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2, but inhibition of mPGES was weaker compared with that of COX-2 in IL-1beta stimulated cells. The results suggest that abundant PGE2 production at inflammation sites such as rheumatoid synovia is caused by the coordinated upregulation of mPGES and COX-2. Thus mPGES might be a potential new target for therapeutic strategies to control PGE2 synthesis specifically in patients with RA and other inflammatory diseases. The protective activity of rosmarinic acid from Perilla frutescens on liver injury induced by LPS in D-GalN-sensitized mice was examined. We also investigated the effects of antitumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody (anti-TNF), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and aminoguanidine (AG) on this model in order to elucidate the mechanism of rosmarinic acid protection. Perilla extract (PE) and rosmarinic acid (RA) treatments significantly reduced the elevation of plasma asparatate aminotransferase levels, as well as anti-TNF and SOD treatment, compared with controls, but this reduction was not seen in the AG group. These results were confirmed by histological examination using hematoxylin-eosin and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression in liver and in plasma TNF-alpha levels, which were observed in control mice, were not significantly reduced by PE or RA. PE and RA treatments also did not significantly diminish iNOS mRNA expression or plasma nitrate/nitrite levels. Nitrotyrosine and N(epsilon)-(hexanonyl)lysine (HEL) production, the residue of oxidative stress, was observed in livers from controls, but not in those mice pretreated with PE or RA. These results suggest that the liver protection of RA is due to the scavenging or reducing activities-superoxide or peroxynitirite rather than to inhibition of TNF-alpha production. Early neural patterning in vertebrates involves signals that inhibit anterior (A) and promote posterior (P) positional values within the nascent neural plate. In this study, we have investigated the contributions of, and interactions between, retinoic acid (RA), Fgf and Wnt signals in the promotion of posterior fates in the ectoderm. We analyze expression and function of cyp26/P450RAI, a gene that encodes retinoic acid 4-hydroxylase, as a tool for investigating these events. Cyp26 is first expressed in the presumptive anterior neural ectoderm and the blastoderm margin at the late blastula. When the posterior neural gene hoxb1b is expressed during gastrulation, it shows a strikingly complementary pattern to cyp26. Using these two genes, as well as otx2 and meis3 as anterior and posterior markers, we show that Fgf and Wnt signals suppress expression of anterior genes, including cyp26. Overexpression of cyp26 suppresses posterior genes, suggesting that the anterior expression of cyp26 is important for restricting the expression of posterior genes. Consistent with this, knock-down of cyp26 by morpholino oligonucleotides leads to the anterior expansion of posterior genes. We further show that Fgf- and Wnt-dependent activation of posterior genes is mediated by RA, whereas suppression of anterior genes does not depend on RA signaling. Fgf and Wnt signals suppress cyp26 expression, while Cyp26 suppresses the RA signal. Thus, cyp26 has an important role in linking the Fgf, Wnt and RA signals to regulate AP patterning of the neural ectoderm in the late blastula to gastrula embryo in zebrafish. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor etoricoxib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A double blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator controlled, 12 week study conducted at 88 US sites. Eligible patients were chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) users with clinical worsening of RA upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAID. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures: patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity and direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints. Key secondary measures: patient global assessment of pain, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the percentage of patients both completing the study and meeting the ACR20 criteria. Tolerability was assessed by tabulation of adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations. In all, 816 patients were randomized (placebo = 323, etoricoxib = 323, naproxen = 170), and 448 completed 12 weeks of treatment (placebo = 122, etoricoxib = 230, naproxen = 96). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p < 0.01). Compared with patients receiving naproxen, patients receiving etoricoxib demonstrated significant improvements (p < 0.05) on all primary endpoints and most other endpoints including ACR20 criteria. The percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response and who completed the study was 21%, 53%, and 39% in the placebo, etoricoxib and naproxen groups, respectively. Etoricoxib and naproxen were both generally well tolerated. In this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than either placebo or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib 90 mg was generally well tolerated in patients with RA. Serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), ceruloplasmin (Cp), and transferrin (Tf) were measured in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the correlations of these parameters with disease activity were investigated. Serum sICAM- 1 levels were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) in serums from 42 patients with RA and 30 healthy controls. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was determined by the Westergren method and C-reactive protein (CRP), Cp, and Tf by nephelometric methods. Disease activity was assessed by standard criteria. Serum Tf levels were significantly diminished and serum levels of sICAM-1 and Cp were significantly increased in patients with RA, compared to healthy controls. Serum sICAM-1 levels showed negative correlation with serum Tf levels (r = -0.47, p < 0.01), and positive correlation with serum Cp levels (r = 0.49, p < 0.001). There was weak positive correlation between sICAM-1 levels and the Ritche articular index (RAI) scores (r = 0.32, p <0.05) and serum CRP levels (r = 0.44, p <0.01), but no significant correlations of sICAM-1 levels with ESR, patient's age, or duration of disease. There were no significant correlations between values of serum CRP, RAI score, or ESR with serum CP or Tf levels. This study indicates that serum sICAM-1, together with other parameters, is a useful and novel marker for evaluating the disease status and activity of patients with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy for pain relief. Currently prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide symptomatic efficacy, but are frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities such as dyspepsia and ulcerations. In a small but significant number of cases, complications including perforations and massive bleeding develop and these may be fatal. A desirable therapeutic strategy would maintain efficacy while minimizing gastric intolerance. Two potential approaches have been suggested: (i) administration of NSAIDs in combination with gastroprotective compounds; or (ii) administration of potentially safer anti-inflammatory compounds which act via selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The selective COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib consistently demonstrate efficacy comparable to conventional NSAIDs in patients with RA and OA, but have a significantly reduced propensity to cause GI toxicity. In many cases, the gastric effects of therapeutically active doses of COX-2 inhibitors are indistinguishable from placebo. The safety benefits of COX-2 inhibitors given alone appear similar to combined therapy with conventional NSAIDs and gastroprotective agents. Findings warrant the consideration of COX-2 inhibitors as first-line therapy in patients requiring long-term pain relief. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) plays a significant role in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. The KSHV open reading frame K9 encodes the viral interferon (IFN) factor 1 (vIRF1), which downregulates IFN- and IRF-mediated transcriptional activation, and leads to cellular transformation in rodent fibroblasts and induction of tumors in nude mice. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality-19 (GRIM19), which interacts directly with vIRF1, both in vivo and in vitro. The N-terminal region of vIRF1 is required for binding GRIM19. Colocalization of vIRF1 and GRIM19 was observed in 293T cells. The vIRF1 protein deregulates GRIM19-induced apoptosis in the presence of IFN/all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and inhibits IFN/RA-induced cell death. Another DNA tumor viral protein, human papillomavirus type 16 E6, also binds GRIM19, suggesting that this is a general target of viral proteins. Our results collectively indicate that vIRF1 modulates IFN/RA-cell death signals via interactions with GRIM19. An association study and a linkage analysis were carried out in parallel in order to investigate the association of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) gene promoter polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predisposition and/or outcome including a -954G-C mutation, a di-allelic (TAAA)(n) marker and the highly polymorphic (CCTTT). The -954G-C point mutation occurred non-polymorphic and the di-allelic (TAAA)(n) marker was not associated with RA predisposition. The (CCTTT)(n)locus showed a trend for RA association in the case-control study, however, stratification data by Class II status did not yield significant effect and overall, the family study showed no significant association nor linkage for any of the markers under study using TDT and non-parametric linkage respectively. Finally, no influence was detected regarding any of the clinical parameters tested. After evaluating for the first time the influence of NOS2 promoter polymorphism in RA, it seems to have no major effect on disease susceptibility and/or outcome. Studies from our laboratory in osteoblast-like cells have shown that the increase in EGF receptor expression in response to PTH was cyclic AMP mediated and was blocked by treatment with retinoic acid (RA). The present studies investigate the mechanism for this effect of RA on PTH actions. UMR 106-01 cells were exposed to RA and were tested for cAMP response to PTH as well as for (125)I PTH binding. cAMP production in response to PTH was markedly decreased by RA (25.1 +/- 1.6% of control) whereas there was only a slight decrease in PTH binding in response to RA. For the study of adenylate cyclase activity, membranes were isolated from intact cells that had been exposed to RA. Treatment with RA decreased PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity; however, forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity was unchanged. Treatment of intact cells with pertussis toxin, to inactivate Gi, did not alter the inhibitory effect of RA on PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Addition of GppNHp, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, completely restored the response to PTH in the membranes. Therefore, we examined the activity of IMP dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme for GTP biosynthesis, and GMP reductase which counteracts the effect of the synthetic enzyme. Treatment with RA for 48 hours increased GMP reductase activity by 240.9 +/- 24.2% and decreased IMP dehydrogenase activity to 67.5 +/- 8.8% of control values. These data indicate that RA impairs the response to PTH in intact cells. This blunted response was preserved in membrane preparations but was corrected by GTP. The RA-induced alterations of enzymes involved in the GTP biosynthetic pathway in a direction that favors a decrease in GTP biosynthesis provide an explanation for the inhibitory effect of RA on PTH actions. Numerous studies, often performed on avian embryos, have implicated retinoic acid (RA) in the control of limb bud growth and patterning. Here we have investigated whether the lack of endogenous RA synthesis affects limb morphogenesis in mutant mouse embryos deficient for the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2/Aldh1a2). These mutants, which have no detectable embryonic RA except in the developing retina, die at E9.5-E10 without any evidence of limb bud formation, but maternal RA supplementation through oral gavage from E7.5 can extend their survival. Such survivors exhibit highly reduced forelimb rudiments, but apparently normal hindlimbs. By providing RA within maternal food, we found both a stage- and dose-dependency for rescue of forelimb growth and patterning. Following RA supplementation from E7.5 to 8.5, mutant forelimbs are markedly hypoplastic and lack anteroposterior (AP) patterning, with a single medial cartilage and 1-2 digit rudiments. RA provided until E9.5 significantly rescues forelimb growth, but cannot restore normal AP patterning. Increasing the RA dose rescues the hypodactyly, but leads to lack of asymmetry of the digit pattern, with abnormally long first digit or symmetrical polydactyly. Mutant forelimb buds are characterized by lack of expression or abnormal distal distribution of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) transcripts, sometimes with highest expression anteriorly. Downregulation or ectopic anterior expression of Fgf4 is also seen. As a result, genes such as Bmp2 or Hoxd genes are expressed symmetrically along the AP axis of the forelimb buds, and/or later, of the autopod. We suggest that RA signaling cooperates with a posteriorly restricted factor such as dHand, to generate a functional zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). Several new drugs have become available for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These agents include selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, leflunomide and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists. COX-2 inhibitors have a more favourable gastrointestinal adverse effect profile than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the COX-2 inhibitors are also associated with hypertension, oedema and congestive heart failure, the well-known adverse effects of conventional NSAIDs. Patients with treated hypertension should be monitored regularly when conventional NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors are administered. At present, there is a considerable debate regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with the COX-2 inhibitors. The available literature gives no unequivocal answers. This matter can only be solved by an appropriate trial assessing the cardiovascular risk of these agents. Patients with RA appear to have an enhanced cardiovascular risk which might be related to an unfavourable lipid profile. Corticosteroids induce hypercholesterolaemia in patients other than those with RA. It was recently shown that total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were low in patients with RA who had a high disease activity. Contrary to the expectation, combination therapy with prednisolone rapidly improved the atherogenic index (total/HDL cholesterol). Ongoing studies investigating this topic are underway. It is not known to what extent corticosteroids induce hypertension in patients with RA. Hence, we advocate blood pressure control for these patients. A small percentage of patients with RA develop hypertension when taking leflunomide, and no other serious cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported in the literature. Blood pressure monitoring is recommended especially in the first months of treatment. TNFalpha antagonists are contraindicated in patients with RA who have congestive heart failure. No specific cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported with the use of these agents in the non-cardiovascular compromised patient. TNFalpha antagonists are the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs presently available. As inflammation plays an important role in RA as well as in cardiovascular disease and, in view of the increased cardiovascular risk in RA, it is tempting to expect that suppression of inflammation ultimately will lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with RA. Expression levels of cytochrome CYP26B1, which is involved in the specific all-trans-RA inactivation, were evaluated in human cephalic tissues at gestational days 57-110 and exhibited values approximately 10-fold higher than later gestational days 112-224 and adult tissues. CYP26B1 mRNA levels in the adult cerebellum were approximately 2-fold higher than in the adult whole brain tissue. Considered together, these data suggest a unique role for CYP26B1 during human brain development. To try clinical response to xefocam, its safety, effects on arterial pressure and heart rhythm variability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with arterial hypertension (HT). Xefocam (lornoxicam), a new non-steroid antiinflammatory drug, was given for 12 weeks in a daily dose 12 mg/day to 44 RA patients (mean age 54.5 +/- 7.3 years). 24-h arterial pressure monitoring was made with Cardiotens-01 device. Xefocam in a dose 12 mg/day has shown good tolerance, a high analgetic and antiinflammatory effect as indicated by a positive response of articular syndrome, a significant fall of systolic arterial pressure, decreased heart rate, better heart rhythm variability. In hypertensive RA patients xefocam in a dose 12 mg/day proved effective and safe. Reln mRNA and protein levels are reduced by approximately 50% in various cortical structures of post-mortem brain from patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar illness with psychosis. To study mechanisms responsible for this down-regulation, we have analyzed the promoter of the human reelin gene. We show that the reelin promoter directs expression of a reporter construct in multiple human cell types: neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y), neuronal precursor cells (NT2), differentiated neurons (hNT) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). Deletion constructs confirmed the presence of multiple elements regulating Reln expression, although the promoter activity is promiscuous, i.e. activity did not correlate with expression of the endogenous gene as reflected in terms of reelin mRNA levels. Co-transfection of the -514 bp human reelin promoter with either Sp1 or Tbr1 demonstrated that these transcription factors activate reporter expression by 6- and 8.5-fold, respectively. Within 400 bp of the RNA start site there are 100 potential CpG targets for DNA methylation. Retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of NT2 cells to hNT neurons was accompanied by increased reelin expression and by the appearance of three DNase I hypersensitive sites 5' to the RNA start site. RA-induced differentiation was also associated with demethylation of the reelin promoter. To test if methylation silenced reelin expression, we methylated the promoter in vitro prior to transfection. In addition, we treated NT2 cells with the methylation inhibitor aza-2'-deoxycytidine and observed a 60-fold increase in reelin mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid also induced expression of the endogenous reelin promoter, although TSA was considerably more potent. These findings indicate that one determinant responsible for regulating reelin expression is the methylation status of the promoter. Our data also raise the interesting possibility that the down-regulation of reelin expression documented in psychiatric patients might be the consequence of inappropriate promoter hypermethylation. Therapy with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has long been the cornerstone of pharmacologic management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many patients with OA or RA, however, are at increased risk of developing clinically significant adverse events associated with NSAID therapy, particularly upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications including symptomatic and complicated ulcers. The introduction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) represents a major advance in the pharmacologic approach to the signs and symptoms of arthritis. In addition to the first two members of this class, celecoxib and rofecoxib, other coxibs have been introduced or are in development (valdecoxib, etoricoxib). In numerous clinical trials, coxibs have been shown to be as effective as nonselective NSAIDs in relieving pain and inflammation associated with OA and RA, and notably, with a significantly lower risk of NSAID-type adverse events. The use of coxibs to treat OA and RA is recommended as first-line therapy when symptoms of pain and inflammation are present in patients vulnerable to potential NSAID-associated GI toxicity. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that, despite recent advances in therapy, still results in significant morbidity, mortality and disability. The aetiology remains unknown and past therapies, although helpful for the majority of patients, have been suboptimal. The recent introduction of newer agents has changed the treatment paradigm of RA. COX-2 inhibitors, anti-TNF agents and interleukin-1 antagonists have allowed us to treat RA more effectively with relatively low risk of side effects. Investigations of other possible treatment pathways, such as inhibition of angiogenesis, may produce still better treatment and rapid unraveling of the immune system and how it relates to RA greatly enhances the opportunities for improved therapeutics in RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common cause of disability in the western population, with an annual incidence of 0.05% and a prevalence of 1%. Although a small percentage of patients go into natural remission, the untreated disease progresses to cause disability, morbidity and early mortality. Unravelling of the cytokine network in the pathogenesis of RA has led to the development of drugs that target these cytokines and prevent joint damage. Three biological anticytokine agents, etanercept, infliximab and anakinra, are now available for use in RA. More experience will quantify their safety and benefits. The potency of the older disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine, is also being realised, especially when used early in the disease process and in combination. Leflunomide is a new DMARD with efficacy similar to methotrexate and sulfasalazine. Symptomatic treatment of RA with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has also undergone a revolution with the availability of a new class of COX-2-specific inhibitors. These drugs control inflammation and provide pain relief with less GI toxicity. Management of comorbid conditions associated with RA and its treatment (i.e., osteoporosis, cardiovascular and lung disease) has also become a priority for the rheumatologist. It is hoped that more aggressive use of conventional DMARDs and biological agents will result in less disability and a higher proportion of patients achieving remission. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been indicated to improve vasopressor-responsiveness and to increase blood pressure in most septic models. However, numerous adverse effects of non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibition have been reported, and the effect of NOS inhibition on vascular responsiveness to vasodilators has not been well studied. Using an isometric tension measurement system of vascular rings, we evaluated the effects of an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor, L-canavanine (L-CAN) and a non-selective NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)-induced vascular hyporeactivity in the four different rabbit arteries. Pretreatment of IL-1 beta inhibited phenylephrine (Phe)-induced vascular constriction in the carotid artery (CA, 49% of control), pulmonary artery (PA, 66%), femoral artery (FA, 71%) and in the renal artery (RA, 83%). A combination of NOS inhibitors attenuated the vascular hyporeactivity to Phe in all arteries. Pretreatment of IL-1 beta also inhibited acetylcholine (Ach)-induced vascular relaxation in FA, RA and CA. In PA, the rings were inversely constricted after Ach administration. The combination of IL-1 beta with L-CAN, but not with L-NAME, attenuated the Ach-induced vasorelaxation to the control level in all arteries. These data suggest that the selective inhibition of iNOS attenuates the direct endothelial damage induced by IL-1 beta in vitro. A novel retinoic acid (RA)-inducible cytochrome P450 (P450 RAI or CYP26), previously cloned from human, zebra fish, and mouse, functions in the metabolism of all-trans-RA to polar metabolites including 4-hydroxy-RA and 4-oxo-RA. To further study CYP26 in the rat model, we first cloned rat CYP26 cDNA. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 497-amino-acid protein whose sequence is 95% identical to mouse and 91% homologous to human CYP26. Animal studies showed that CYP26 mRNA expression is very low (0.01+/-0.008;P<0.05) in vitamin-A-deficient rats compared to pair-fed vitamin-A-sufficient rats (defined as 1.0). In a kinetic study, vitamin-A-deficient rats were treated with approximately 100 microg of all-trans-RA and liver was collected after 3-72 h for analysis of CYP26 mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR. Liver CYP26 mRNA increased to nearly 10-fold above control after 3 h (P<0.01), reaching a peak of about 2000-fold greater around 10 h (P<0.001) and then decreased rapidly. The CYP26 dose response to RA was nearly linear (R(2)=0.9638). Additionally, significant regulation of CYP26 gene expression was observed in the vitamin-A-deficient, control, and RA-treated condition in lung, testis, and small intestine. We conclude that CYP26 mRNA expression is dynamically regulated in vivo by diet and RA in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. The long-term down-regulation of CYP26 in retinoid deficiency may be critical for conserving RA, while the acute up-regulation of CYP26 may be important for preventing a deleterious overshoot of RA derived from either dietary or exogenous sources. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine released from T-cells and macrophages, and is a key molecule in inflammation. Although a detailed understanding of the biological functions of MIF has not yet been found, it is known that MIF catalyzes the tautomerization of phenylpyruvate and a non-physiological molecule, D-dopachrome. A potent tautomerase inhibitor would be expected, as a validation tool, to shed light on role of MIF activity and the relationship between its biological and enzymatic activity. Such tautomerase inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of MIF-related diseases, such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), nephropathy and tumors. In this review, we have focused on (1) the biological and enzymatic activities of MIF, (2) the discovery of novel, drug-like tautomerase inhibitors of MIF using a structure-based computer-assisted search, and (3) a crystallographic and molecular modeling study of the MIF-tautomerase inhibitor complexes (A review with 133 references). A number of studies have suggested that retinoic acid (RA) is an important signal for patterning the hindbrain, the branchial arches and the limb bud. Retinoic acid is thought to act on the posterior hindbrain and the limb buds at somitogenesis stages in chick and mouse embryos. Here we report a much earlier requirement for RA signalling during pre-segmentation stages for proper development of these structures in zebrafish. We present evidence that a RA signal is necessary during pre-segmentation stages for proper expression of the spinal cord markers hoxb5a and hoxb6b, suggesting an influence of RA on anteroposterior patterning of the neural plate posterior to the hindbrain. We report the identification and expression pattern of the zebrafish retinaldehyde dehydrogenase2 (raldh2/aldh1a2) gene. Raldh2 synthesises retinoic acid (RA) from its immediate precursor retinal. It is expressed in a highly ordered spatial and temporal fashion during gastrulation in the involuting mesoderm and during later embryogenesis in paraxial mesoderm, branchial arches, eyes and fin buds, suggesting the involvement of RA at different times of development in different functional contexts. Mapping of the raldh2 gene reveals close linkage to no-fin (nof), a newly discovered mutant lacking pectoral fins and cartilaginous gill arches. Cloning and functional tests of the wild-type and nof alleles of raldh2 reveal that nof is a raldh2 mutant. By treating nof mutants with RA during different time windows and by making use of a retinoic acid receptor antagonist, we show that RA signalling during pre-segmentation stages is necessary for anteroposterior patterning in the CNS and for fin induction to occur. To study (i) the influence of methotrexate (MTX) therapy on homocysteine and folate metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (ii) the influence of the C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) on the change in plasma homocysteine levels during MTX treatment, and (iii) the interference of folate and homocysteine metabolism with the efficacy and toxicity of treatment with MTX. The 113 patients enrolled in this study were participating in a 48-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment with and without folic or folinic acid supplementation. The MTX dose was 7.5 mg/week initially and increased to a maximum of 25 mg/week if necessary. Concentrations of total folate, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (in serum and in erythrocytes) and of homocysteine, cysteine and cysteine-glycine and the MTHFR genotype were determined before the start of the study, after 6 weeks, and after 48 weeks or on withdrawal from the study. Blood was drawn from fasting patients at a standardized time in the morning, 16 h after intake of MTX. The laboratory results were related to parameters of efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment. Baseline values were distributed equally in the three treatment groups. The mean plasma homocysteine level (normal range 6-15 micromol/l) before the start of MTX was relatively high in all groups: 15.4 micromol/l [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.5 to 17.2] in the MTX plus placebo group (n=39), 14.3 micromol/l (95% CI 12.2 to 16.4) in the MTX plus folic acid group (n=35) and 15.9 micromol/l (95% CI 13.7 to 18.1) in the MTX plus folinic acid group (n=39). After 48 weeks of MTX therapy, the mean homocysteine level showed an increase in the placebo group (+3.6 micromol/l, 95% CI 1.7 to 5.6). In contrast, a decrease was observed in the groups supplemented with folic or folinic acid (folic acid, -2.7 micromol/l, 95% CI -1.4 to -4.0; folinic acid, -1.6 micromol/l, 95% CI -0.1 to -3.0). The differences in the change in plasma homocysteine level between the placebo group and each of the two folate-supplemented groups were statistically significant (P<0.0001), contrary to the difference between the folic and folinic acid groups (P=0.26). Linear regression analysis showed that the change in plasma homocysteine level was statistically significantly associated with folic or folinic acid supplementation (P=0.0001) but not with the presence or absence of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene. Homozygous mutants had a higher plasma homocysteine concentration at baseline. No relationship was found between the change in disease activity and the change in homocysteine concentration or the mean homocysteine concentration after 48 weeks of MTX therapy. Toxicity-related discontinuation of MTX treatment was not associated with the change in homocysteine concentration. Low-dose MTX treatment in RA patients leads to an increased plasma homocysteine level. Concomitant folate supplementation with either folic or folinic acid decreases the plasma homocysteine level and consequently protects against potential cardiovascular risks. No relationship was found between the change in homocysteine concentration and the presence or absence of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene. Homocysteine metabolism was not associated with efficacy or toxicity of MTX treatment. The present study reports a fast, economical, and feasible way to extract antioxidant phenolics from artichoke byproducts: raw artichoke (RA), blanched (thermally treated) artichoke (BA), and artichoke blanching waters (ABW). These byproducts represent a huge amount of discarded material in some industries. Two protocols, with possible industrial applicability, based on both methanol and water extractions were used. Phenolic contents (expressed as caffeic acid derivatives) (grams per 100 g of dry extract) were 15.4 and 9.9 for RA when extracted with methanol and water, respectively; 24.3 and 10.3 for BA when extracted with methanol and water, respectively; and finally, 11.3 g of phenolics/100 mL of ABW. Therefore, methanol extracts yielded more phenolics than water extracts, especially when BA byproducts were used. The higher amount of phenolics in BA could be due to the inactivation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) at the industrial scale (due to blanching process), avoiding PPO-catalyzed oxidation of these phenolics, a phenomenon that could occur in RA byproducts. Artichoke extracts from industrial byproducts showed a high free radical scavenging activity (versus both DPPH* and ABTS*+ radicals) as well as capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation (ferric thiocyanate method). According to these results, the use of artichoke extracts from industrial byproducts as possible ingredients to functionalize foodstuffs (to decrease lipid peroxidation and to increase health-promoting properties) is suggested. The identification of COX-2 less than a decade ago has been followed by an unprecedented period of discovery and drug development (Golden & Abramson, 1999). Clinical studies thus far have established that the selective COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) are effective in the treatment of OA and RA, as are conventional NSAIDs. However, they do not cause the same adverse effects on the GI mucosa nor do they increase bleeding time as do conventional NSAIDs. Therefore, their use is not contraindicated in pre or postsurgical patients. Further investigation is underway to fully elucidate the role of COX-2 and to determine any additional benefits of selective COX-2 inhibition. Nonrandom assignment of therapy in observational studies and clinical practice can be accompanied by channeling bias and confounding by indication. This in turn can lead to unreliable conclusions about treatment effectiveness. Although widely acknowledged as important, no studies in rheumatology have measured the extent of these biases. We identified variables contributing to confounding and investigated the strength of the confounding effect. Analytical methods (propensity scores) are available to mitigate the effect of nonrandom assignment if the full extent of confounding can be understood. A population of 6637 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) from the practices of 433 US rheumatologists completed 2 sets of detailed questionnaires concerning (1) the last 6 months in 1998 and (2) the first 6 months of 1999, generally prior to and after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients who received the COX-2 specific inhibitors in period 2 were identified (n = 1517), and their characteristics were compared to the 5120 who did not start a new COX-2 specific inhibitor during Period 1. Patients starting a new COX-2 specific inhibitor had a greater lifetime history of adverse reactions of all kinds, but particularly gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. They also had more severe scores for pain, functional disability, fatigue, helplessness, and global severity, and they used more inpatient and outpatients services than patients who would not switch to COX-2 specific inhibitors. Confounding by indication and channeling bias result in an overall increase in severity of about 25% for the above measures. Observational studies should account for these biases by a broadly defined propensity score that includes the variables identified in this report. These observations are germane to observational studies of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, as well, and suggest the need for careful control of confounders when assessing treatment effects in rheumatic disease observational studies. Pharmacia (formerly Searle), in collaboration with Pfizer and Yamanouchi, has developed valdecoxib, a second-generation cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor as a follow-up to celecoxib, for the treatment of arthritis. Pharmacia filed an NDA with the FDA in March 2001 for the treatment of acute pain, dysmenorrhea, osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At this time, Pharmacia anticipated a 12-month review [402883]. In June 2001, launch was anticipated in 2002 [412616], and in November 2001, valdecoxib was granted FDA approval [429715]. The company claims that valdecoxib has improved potency and broader therapeutic range than other COX-2 inhibitors including celecoxib, and has the potential for once-daily dosing [287279], [313957]. By 1999, due to the poor water solubility of valdecoxib, Searle was also developing the prodrug parecoxib [324667]. Valdecoxib has been described by Searle as almost superimposable at the site critical for COX-2 inhibition, a structural side pocket in the enzyme which coincides with the sulfonamide group of the drug [324667]. In April 2000, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter estimated sales would be US $400 million in 2003, rising to US $750 million in 2004 [375906]. In April 2001, Merrill Lynch predicted world sales of US $460 million in 2002, rising to $1,065 million in 2005 [420574]. In September 2000, Merrill Lynch reported that additional pain data were being accumulated for this drug, the possible inclusion of which could push filing back to later in the first half of 2001 [382577]. In May 2001, Merrill Lynch expected launch in 2002 [411811]. In August 2001, Lehman Brothers predicted that launch would take place in thefirst half of 2002 and the product would make peak sales of US $1,500 million [420809]. Credit Suisse predicted in this month that total sales would reach US $330 million in 2002, rising to US $1832 million in 2004 [422318]. In September 2001, Morgan Stanley expected launch in the first half of 2002 [427113]. By October 2001, Credit Suisse had revised its sales predictions to US $180 million in 2002, US $790 million in 2003 and US $1,430 in 2004 [427185]. The aim of this study was to compare the effects on NO production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 with those of TGF-beta. RA synovial cells were stimulated for 24 h with IL-1 beta (1 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (500 pg/ml), IFN-gamma (10(-4)IU/ml) alone or in combination. Nitrite was determined by the Griess reaction, S-nitrosothiols by fluorescence, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by immunofluorescence and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis (FACS). In other experiments, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF beta were used at various concentrations and were added in combination with proinflammatory cytokines. The addition of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma together increased nitrite production: 257.5 +/- 35.8 % and S-nitrosothiol production : 413 +/- 29%, P < 0.001. None of these cytokines added alone had any significant effect. iNOS synthesis increased with NO production. IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF beta strongly decreased the NO production caused by the combination of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. These results demonstrate that stimulated RA synoviocytes produce S-nitrosothiols, bioactive NO* compounds, in similar quantities to nitrite. IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-beta decrease NO production by RA synovial cells. The anti-inflammatory properties of these cytokines may thus be due at least in part to their effect on NO metabolism. Combined enzymatic oxidation of D-galactose by D-galactose oxidase [EC 1.1.3.9] in water, amination with butylamine, and oxalic acid catalyzed Amadori rearrangement in methanol yielded 1,6-bis(butylamino)-1,6-dideoxy-erythro-hexo-2,5-diulose, demonstrating how in situ formed galacto-hexodialdose can be used to cross-link protein residues. The various species formed during this three-step conversion are present as bicyclic structures in solution as established by 13C labeling and in situ NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixtures. Using protein (gelatin) instead of butylamine, distinct Amadori product formation was observed using 99% enriched D-(1-(13)C)- and D-(2-(13)C)-galactose. The nitric oxide (NO)/guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) pathway plays an essential role in mediating pulmonary vasodilatation during transition of the pulmonary circulation at birth. We used immunoblot analysis (Western) and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry to study the presence, distribution, and relative amounts of type I nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I). Immunoblots were performed on normal fetal sheep lungs, whereas immunohistochemistry for NOS-I was compared between lungs from normal fetal lambs vs. fetal lambs with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) induced by ligation of the ductus arteriosus. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody detected NOS-I protein in homogenates of normal fetal sheep lungs. Abundant NOS-I immunoreactivity was observed exclusively in the precapillary resistance vessels, i.e., terminal bronchiole-associated arteries (TA) and respiratory bronchiole-associated arteries (RA) in normal fetal lung. In marked contrast, immunoreactivity for NOS-I was significantly reduced in the TA and RA of hypertensive lungs. We conclude that there is a heterogeneous distribution of NOS-I in the normal fetal sheep lung, but that NOS-I staining is significantly reduced in lambs with PPHN. Retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) isozymes catalyze the terminal oxidation of retinol into retinoic acid (RA) that is essential for embryogenesis and tissue differentiation. To understand the role of mouse type 2 RALDH in synthesizing the ligands (all-trans and 9-cis RA) needed to bind and activate nuclear RA receptors, we determined the detailed kinetic properties of RALDH2 for various retinal substrates. Purified recombinant RALDH2 showed a pH optimum of 9.0 for all-trans retinal oxidation. The activity of the enzyme was lower at 37 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C. The efficiency of conversion of all-trans retinal to RA was 2- and 5-fold higher than 13-cis and 9-cis retinal, respectively. The K(m) for all-trans and 13-cis retinal were similar (0.66 and 0.62 microM, respectively). However, the K(m) of RALDH2 for 9-cis retinal substrate (2.25 microM) was 3-fold higher compared to all-trans and 13-cis retinal substrates. Among several reagents tested for their ability to either inhibit or activate RALDH2, citral and para-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (p-HMB) inhibited and MgCl(2) activated the reaction. Comparison of the kinetic properties of RALDH2 for retinal substrates and its activity towards various reagents with those of previously reported rat kidney RALDH1 and human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 showed distinct differences. Since RALDH2 has low K(m) and high catalytic efficiency for all-trans retinal, it may likely be involved in the production of all-trans RA in vivo. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) or carnosol, two structurally unrelated compounds with anticancer properties, inhibited phorbol ester (PMA)-mediated induction of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human mammary epithelial cells. The induction of COX-2 transcription by PMA was mediated by increased binding of AP-1 to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) of the COX-2 promoter. Inhibition of the histone acetyltransferase activity of CREB- binding protein (CBP)/p300 blocked the induction of COX-2 by PMA. Treatment with carnosol but not RA blocked increased binding of AP-1 to the COX-2 promoter. Because AP-1 binding was unaffected by RA, we investigated whether RA inhibited COX-2 transcription via effects on the coactivator CBP/p300. Treatment with RA stimulated an interaction between RA receptor-alpha and CBP/p300; a corresponding decrease in the interaction between CBP/p300 and c-Jun was observed. Importantly, overexpressing CBP/p300 or dominant-negative RA receptor-alpha relieved the suppressive effect of RA on PMA-mediated stimulation of the COX-2 promoter. To elucidate the mechanism by which carnosol inhibited COX-2 transcription, its effects on protein kinase C (PKC) signaling were determined. Carnosol but not RA inhibited the activation of PKC, ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase. Overexpressing c-Jun but not CBP/p300 reversed the suppressive effect of carnosol on PMA-mediated stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity. Thus, RA acted by a receptor-dependent mechanism to limit the amount of CBP/p300 that was available for AP-1-mediated induction of COX-2. By contrast, carnosol inhibited the induction of COX-2 by blocking PKC signaling and thereby the binding of AP-1 to the CRE of the COX-2 promoter. Taken together, these results show that small molecules can block the activation of COX-2 transcription by distinct mechanisms. Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) A and B are two isoenzymes involved in the degradation of many biological amines in the nervous system and in peripheral organs. In the present work hepatocytes isolated from 14-day-old chick embryos were used as a model system to determine whether retinoic acid (RA) is capable of modulating the activity of the two MAO forms. RA is a retinoid that, by binding with nuclear receptors, interferes with the expression of specific genes in many differentiation processes. Enzymic activity was measured with a radiochemical method using serotonin and beta-phenylethylamine as preferential substrates for MAO A and MAO B, respectively. The specific activity of the two forms was measured in hepatocytes cultured for 24, 48 and 72 h in the presence and the absence of serum. RA stimulated MAO B but not MAO A activity, in a dose- and time-dependent way, and only in the presence of serum. Maximum stimulation (about 3.5-fold) was obtained after treatment with 5 microM RA for 72 h. Kinetic analysis of MAO B activity showed an increase in V(max) in treated hepatocytes (5 microM RA for 72 h) with no change in K(m). In conclusion, the present work shows that RA selectively elicits MAO B activity in cultured chick embryonic hepatocytes, this stimulation requires the presence of some factors present in the serum and is probably due to an increase in the number of enzyme molecules. To study the effect of the inhibitor of cytochrome P450 known as Lilly 18947 (2,4 dichloro-6 phenylphenoxy ethyl diethylamine) on Trypanosoma cruzi. Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes were grown in culture, in absence or in presence of drug. The inhibition of its growth was followed by daily counting using a Neubauer chamber. The effect of Lilly 18947 on the parasite ultrastructure was examined by electron microscopy. To test the effect of different concentrations of drug on the parasite cycle, Vero cells were inoculated with trypomastigotes (RA strain) and after 72 h the percentage of infected cells and the number of intracellular parasites were estimated and expressed as the endocytic index. Growth of epimastigotes was inhibited by Lilly 18947. Concentrations as low a s 50 micromol/L resulted in a complete disappearance of the parasites in culture by the fourth day. With lower concentrations, little growth was observed and total (25 micro mol/L) or partial lysis (10 micromol/L) were registered by the eighth day of culture. Incubation of epimastigotes with 50 micromol/L of Lilly 18947 resulted in an early damage to cellular structures. Initial signs were dilatation of perinuclear membranes and mitochondria swelling. The infectivity of trypomastigotes to Vero cells in culture was nearly abolished at 15 and 30 micromol/L concentrations of the drug. Lilly 18947 was able to harm Trypanosoma cruzi membrane functions leading to t he loss of its infective properties and its death. Substantial evidence indicates that one consequence of alcohol intoxication is a reduction in retinoic acid (RA) levels. Studies on the mechanism have shown that chronic ethanol consumption induces P450 enzymes that increase RA degradation, thus accounting for much but not all of the observed decrease in RA. A reduction in RA synthesis may also be involved as ethanol competitively inhibits retinol oxidation catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in vitro. This may be important during acute ethanol intoxication and may contribute to adverse retinol/ethanol drug interactions. Here we have examined mice for the effect of either acute ethanol intoxication or Adh1 gene disruption on RA synthesis and degradation. RA produced following a dose of retinol (50 mg/kg) was reduced 87% by pretreatment with an intoxicating dose of ethanol (3.5 g/kg). RA produced in Adh1-null mutant mice following a 50-mg/kg dose of retinol was reduced 82% relative to wild-type mice, thus similar to wild-type mice pretreated with ethanol. Reduced RA production was associated with increased retinol levels in both ethanol-treated wild-type mice and Adh1-null mutant mice, indicating reduced clearance of the retinol dose. RA degradation following a dose of RA (10 mg/kg) was increased only 42% by ethanol pretreatment (3.5 g/kg) and only 26% in Adh1-null mutant mice relative to wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the reduced RA levels observed during acute retinol/ethanol drug interaction are due primarily to a decrease in ADH-catalyzed RA synthesis and secondarily to an increase in RA degradation. Influence of vitamin A (retinol) on growth depends on its sequential oxidation to retinal and then to retinoic acid (RA), producing a ligand for RA receptors essential in development of specific tissues. Genetic studies have revealed that aldehyde dehydrogenases function as tissue-specific catalysts for oxidation of retinal to RA. However, enzymes catalyzing the first step of RA synthesis, oxidation of retinol to retinal, remain unclear because none of the present candidate enzymes have expression patterns that fully overlap with those of aldehyde dehydrogenases during development. Here, we provide genetic evidence that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) performs this function by demonstrating a role for Adh3, a ubiquitously expressed form. Adh3 null mutant mice exhibit reduced RA generation in vivo, growth deficiency that can be rescued by retinol supplementation, and completely penetrant postnatal lethality during vitamin A deficiency. ADH3 was also shown to have in vitro retinol oxidation activity. Unlike the second step, the first step of RA synthesis is not tissue-restricted because it is catalyzed by ADH3, a ubiquitous enzyme having an ancient origin. Retinoid control of vertebrate development depends upon tissue-specific metabolism of retinol to retinoic acid (RA). The RA biosynthetic enzyme RALDH2 catalyzes much, but not all, RA production in mouse embryos, as revealed here with Raldh2 null mutants carrying an RA-responsive transgene. Targeted disruption of Raldh2 arrests development at midgestation and eliminates all RA synthesis except that associated with Raldh3 expression in the surface ectoderm of the eye field. Conditional rescue of Raldh2(-/-) embryos by limited maternal RA administration allows development to proceed and results in the establishment of additional sites of RA synthesis linked to Raldh1 expression in the dorsal retina and to Raldh3 expression in the ventral retina, olfactory pit and urinary tract. Unexpectedly, conditionally rescued Raldh2(-/-) embryos also possess novel sites of RA synthesis in the neural tube and heart that do not correspond to expression of Raldh1-3. RA synthesis in the mutant neural tube was localized in the spinal cord, posterior hindbrain and portions of the midbrain and forebrain, whereas activity in the mutant heart was localized in the conotruncus and sinus venosa. In the posterior hindbrain, this novel RA-generating activity was expressed during establishment of rhombomeric boundaries. In the spinal cord, the novel activity was localized in the floorplate plus in the intermediate region where retinoid-dependent interneurons develop. These novel RA-generating activities in the neural tube and heart fill gaps in our knowledge of how RA is generated spatiotemporally and may, along with Raldh1 and Raldh3, contribute to rescue of Raldh2(-/-) embryos by producing RA locally. We hypothesized that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) with leukocyte-targeted microbubbles could temporally and spatially characterize the severity of postischemic myocardial inflammation. In 9 open-chest dogs, either the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 90 minutes (n=6), while the remaining dogs served as non-ischemic controls. During occlusion, MCE was performed to determine the risk area (RA) and regions supplied by collateral flow. Myocardial inflammation was assessed 5, 60, and 120 minutes after reflow by MCE imaging of leukocyte-targeted (phosphatidylserine-containing) lipid microbubbles. The spatial extent and severity of inflammation were also assessed by radionuclide imaging of the neutrophil-avid tracer 99mTcRP517 and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Early after reflow, MCE detected inflammation throughout the entire risk area, the extent of which decreased over time due to reduced signal in collateral-supplied regions. The spatial extent of inflammation late after reflow was similar for MCE and radionuclide imaging. The severity of inflammation in the infarct zone, the noninfarcted risk area, and collateral-supplied territories determined by quantitative MCE correlated well with myeloperoxidase activity (r=0.81). MCE with leukocyte-targeted microbubbles can temporally assess the severity and extent of postischemic myocardial inflammation and could be used to evaluate new treatment strategies designed to limit inflammation in acute coronary syndromes. In general, wild Escherichia coli strains can grow effectively under moderately acidic organic acid-rich conditions. We found that the Shiga Toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O157:H7 NGY9 grows more quickly than a K-12 strain in Luria-Bertani (LB)-2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) broth supplemented with acetic acid (pH 5.4). Hypothesizing that the resistance of STEC O157:H7 to acetic acid is as a result of a mechanism(s) other than those known, we screened for STEC mutants sensitive to acetic acid. NGY9 was subjected to mini-Tn5 mutagenesis and, from 50,000 colonies, five mutants that showed a clear acetic acid-sensitive phenotype were isolated. The insertion of mini-Tn5 in three mutants occurred at the fcl, wecA (rfe) and wecB (rffE) genes and caused loss of surface O-polysaccharide, loss of both O-polysaccharide and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and loss of ECA respectively. The other two mutants showed inactivation of the waaG (rfaG) gene but at different positions that caused a deep rough mutant with loss of the outer core oligosaccharide of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as phenotypic loss of O-polysaccharide and ECA. With the introduction of plasmids carrying the fcl, wecA, wecB and waaG genes, respectively, all mutants were complemented in their production of O-polysaccharide and ECA, and normal growth was restored in organic acid-rich culture conditions. We also found that the growth of Salmonella LPS mutants Ra, Rb1, Rc, Rd1, Rd2 and Re was suppressed in the presence of acetic acid compared with that of the parents. These results suggest that the full expression of LPS (including O-polysaccharide) and ECA is indispensable to the resistance against acetic acid and other short chain fatty acids in STEC O157:H7 and Salmonella. To the best of our knowledge, this is a newly identified physiological role for O-polysaccharide and ECA as well as an acid resistance mechanism. We report a rare case of nephrotic syndrome in an elderly woman with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody(ANCA). The patient was 81 years of age and had a history of interstitial pneumonia. She was diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis(RA) at admission. Rapidly progressing renal damage was found with mild microscopic hematuria and positive ANCA. The renal biopsy findings indicated membranous nephropathy. Neither gold nor anti-rheumatic drugs had been previously administered. She may have had an RA-specific membranous nephropathy. Crescentic formation was not clear. With hematuria, the leukocyte infiltration in the capillary lumen and the change in epithelial cells of Bowman's capsules would be histological findings suggesting ANCA-associated nephritis. This is a rare report on membranous nephropathy in an RA patient with ANCA-associated nephritis. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) can be catabolized to polar metabolites by microsomal P450s (P450). The aim of this study was to confirm if retinoic acid 4-hydroxylase (CYP26) is a P450 induced by RA and to investigate the role of cellular RA binding proteins (CRABPs), using a slow catabolizer, AMC-HN-4, and a rapid catabolizer, AMC-HN-6. Also, we analyzed the effect of RA catabolism on cell proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in vitro and in vivo. Both cell lines weakly expressed CYP26 and CRABPs, but RA induced CYP26 only in AMC-HN-6. The sensitivity to RA was variable by the amount of CYP26, and the rapid catabolism by CYP26 made AMC-HN-6 resistant to RA in vitro. In addition, The RA had a stronger effect on the inhibition of tumor growth of AMC-HN-4 than that of AMC-HN-6 in vivo. Conclusively, the CYP26 activity might be one essential factor for the RA sensitivity, but in cells showing induction of CYP26, the RA sensitivity is inversely related to the rate of RA catabolism. The purpose of this work was to identify the principal human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in the metabolism of the retinoic acid (RA) isomers, 9-cis- and 13-cis-RA, by using a combination of techniques including human liver microsomes (correlation of activity and inhibition), and lymphoblast microsomes expressing a single CYP. Concerning the 9-cis-RA, 4-OH- and 4-oxo-9-cis-RA were formed with human liver microsomes, and their formation correlated with activities linked to CYPs 3A4/5, 2B6, 2C8, 2A6, and 2C9. The use of lymphoblast microsomes expressing a single human CYP identified CYPs 2C9>2C8>3A7 as the most active in the formation of 4-OH-9-cis-RA. With regard to 13-cis-RA, specific P450 activities linked to CYPs 2B6, 2C8, 3A4/5, and 2A6 were correlated with the formation of 4-OH- and 4-oxo-13-cis-RA. Microsomes expressing a single CYP identified CYPs 3A7, 2C8, 4A11, 1B1, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 (decreasing activity) in the formation of 4-OH-13-cis-RA. The use of CYP-specific inhibitors in human liver microsomes disclosed that the formation of the 4-OH-9-cis-RA was best inhibited by sulfaphenazole (72%) and quercetin (66%), whereas ketoconazole and troleandomycin inhibited its formation by 55 and 38%, respectively; the formation of 4-OH-13-cis-RA was best inhibited by troleandomycin (54%) and ketoconazole (46%), whereas quercetin was a weak inhibitor (14%). In conclusion, adult human CYPs 2C9, 2C8, 3A4 have been identified as active in the 9-cis-RA metabolism, whereas CYPs 3A4 and 2C8 were active in 13-cis-RA metabolism. The fetal form CYP3A7 was also identified as very active in either 9-cis- or 13-cis-RA metabolism. The role of these human CYPs in the biological response or resistance to RA isomers remains to be determined. This Phase III, placebo and active controlled, multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg daily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A 12 week, randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group trial compared daily oral meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg to placebo (negative control) and diclofenac 75 mg BID (positive control). A total of 894 patients (18 years of age with confirmed RA who flared following an NSAID-free period) were randomized to be treated. Baseline scores for all endpoints were similar among the treatment groups. Patient assessments were at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or early termination. All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.001). Meloxicam 7.5 and 22.5 mg was significantly superior to placebo in all 5 primary efficacy endpoints (swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient pain, patient and physician global; all p < 0.05). Diclofenac 150 mg was superior to placebo for 4 of 5 primary efficacy measures (all but swollen joint count; p < 0.05) and meloxicam 15 mg was superior for 3 of 5 primary endpoints (patient pain and patient and physician global). AUC of patient global, patient pain, and modified Health Assessment Questionnaire demonstrated dose-response (p < 0.04), while AUC ACR20 showed a qualitative trend in the same direction. The rate of gastrointestinal (GI) events during the 12 week trial for all doses of meloxicam and diclofenac did not differ significantly from placebo (23.2-32.0%). GI withdrawals were comparable and not significantly different across all treatment groups (4.3-5.7%). This trial demonstrated a dose response relationship for meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg using AUC measurement of response for the treatment of RA. All 3 doses of meloxicam. and positive control, were effective in the treatment of RA. The overall incidence rate of GI events did not differ significantly from placebo in either the meloxicam treatment groups or the positive control. Density of sympathetic nerve fibers in synovial tissue was lower in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to those with osteoarthritis (OA). This was accompanied by norepinephrine (NE) release from synovial tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells (TH+ cells). We investigated the role of TH+ cells and NE in synovial inflammation. Synovial tissue of 34 patients with RA and 36 with OA who underwent knee joint replacement surgery was characterized using immunohistochemistry and a synovial tissue superfusion technique, respectively. In culture experiments with mixed synoviocytes, the effect of NE on secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) was investigated. Tissue density of TH+ cells was higher in RA compared to OA (63.9 vs 34.2 cells/mm2; p = 0.017). Basal NE release from synovial tissue correlated highly significantly with density of TH+ cells in RA (Rrank = 0.573, p = 0.001) but not in OA (Rrank = 0.102, NS). Basal NE release correlated with the degree of inflammation in RA (Rrank = 0.420, p = 0.021) but not in OA (Rrank = 0.174, NS), and with spontaneous IL-8 secretion in RA (Rrank = 0.581, p = 0.001) but not in OA (Rrank = 0.160, NS). Only in RA, density of TH+ cells correlated positively with spontaneous secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-3. We confirmed the extensive loss of sympathetic nerve fibers in RA compared to OA (0.32 vs 3.1 nerve fiber/mm2; p < 0.001). The ratio of sympathetic to sensory nerve fibers was 1 to 5 in RA and 2 to 1 in OA. A ratio of 1.0 separates almost all patients into 2 diseases groups (RA vs OA). Prior prednisolone treatment of RA patients was related to decreased spontaneous cytokine secretion, a lower density of T cells, CD163+ macrophages and TH+ cells, a lower degree of inflammation, and reduced synovial NE secretion. NE was able to inhibit secretion of IL-6 (in OA), IL-8 (in RA), and TNF (in RA and OA) in culture experiments. TH+ cells and release of NE are strongly linked to a higher degree of synovial inflammation. Culture experiments indicate that NE has antiinflammatory properties at higher concentrations (10(-5) M). NE secretion of TH+ cells may be an antiinflammatory mechanism to counteract local inflammation. Thus, TH+ cell derived NE can be an important local factor of immunomodulation in synovial inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease with polyarticular synovitis leading to formation of rheumatoid pannus and subsequent erosion of articular cartilage and bone. Prostaglandins (PGs)--a group of arachidonic acid metabolites found at elevated levels in synovial fluid and synovial membrane are considered to play a pivotal role in development of vasodilatation, fluid extravasation and pain in synovial tissues. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that PGs (especially prostaglandin E2) are mediators involved in complex interactions leading to development of erosions of articular cartilage and juxta-articular bone. Cyclooxygenase is an enzyme playing crucial role in PGs production. It is known that two forms of cyclooxygenase exist: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) playing house-keeping functions and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) involved in inflammatory responses. Synovial tissues from patients with RA are shown to contain COX-2 and to a less extent COX-1. COX-2 expression in rheumatoid synovium is induced by proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, while corticosteroids are capable of inhibiting COX-2 expression. The understanding of crucial role of COX-2 in synovial inflammation led to development of new group of anti-inflammatory agents--selective COX-2 inhibitors, that inhibit specifically COX-2, providing effective anti-inflammatory action without the side effects associated with inhibition of COX-1. In the context of widespread use of selective COX-2 inhibitors hypothetical role of COX-1 in RA pathology should be elucidated. In the present study, the ontogenesis of nitrergic neurons has been studied in the urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl by means of NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd) histochemistry and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunohistochemistry. Embryonic and larval stages were studied. Except for the olfactory fibers and glomeruli, both methods were equally suitable to reveal nitrergic structures in the brain. The earliest positive neurons were observed in the inferior reticular nucleus (Ri) in the caudal rhombencephalon at embryonic stage 30. At stage 33b, weakly reactive cells appeared in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and isthmus, in the ventral hypothalamus (VH), and in the proximity of the solitary tract (sol). At initial larval stages (stages 34-38), two new groups appeared in the caudal telencephalon (future amygdaloid complex (Am)) and in the middle reticular nucleus (Rm) of the rhombencephalon. During the active larval life (stages 39-55c) the nitrergic system developed progressively both in number of cells and fiber tracts. At stages 39-42 reactive cells were found in the inner granular layer (igl) of the olfactory bulb, the telencephalic pallium, the pretectal region, the optic tectum (OT) and retina. New populations of nitrergic cells appear during the second half of the larval period (stages 52-55). Rostrally, reactive cells were found in the telencephalic diagonal band (DB) nucleus, medial septum and in the thalamic eminence (TE), whereas caudally cells appeared in the raphe (Ra) and the descending trigeminal nucleus (Vd). The last changes occurred during the juvenile period (metamorphic climax), when cells of the spinal cord (sc) and the preoptic area became positive. The sequence of appearance of nitrergic cells revealed a first involvement of this system in reticulospinal control, likely influencing locomotor behavior. As development proceeds, cells in different sensory systems expressed progressively nitric oxide synthase in a pattern that shows many similarities with amniotes. Since retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta mRNA is frequently lost during esophageal carcinogenesis and esophageal cancer cells that do not express RAR-beta are resistant to retinoic acid (RA), we stably transfected RAR-beta expression vector into an esophageal cancer cell line TE-8 and an antisense RAR-beta into TE-3 cells. Transfection of RAR-beta decreased cell growth and colony formation and induced apoptosis in TE-8 cells. Antisense RAR-beta-transfected TE-3 cells had a shorter doubling time and became resistant to RA. Induction of RAR-beta decreased COX-2 expression in RAR-beta transfected TE-8 cells, whereas antisense RAR-beta transfected TE-3 cells increased COX-2 expression. The inhibitory effect of RAR-beta on COX-2 expression was further enhanced in the presence of RA, which was blocked by an RAR antagonist. The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide, which does not bind effectively to RAR-beta, had no effect on COX-2 suppression. Furthermore, RA blocked bile acid-induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E(2) production only in the RAR-beta positive cells. Our data demonstrated that anticancer effect of RAR-beta may be related to its ability to suppress COX-2 expression and support that the loss of RAR-beta expression may contribute to esophageal carcinogenesis. The retinoic acid (RA)-dependent mechanisms that orchestrate the development of the hindbrain have been the focus of intense studies over the last decade. A wide range of model systems and experimental approaches have been used to provide important insights into hindbrain patterning. A recent paper could help to unify seemingly disparate observations across species and experimental approaches. Specification of the entire caudal hindbrain is fully dependent on retinoic acid, and specification of individual rhombomeres (r) follows a strict rostrocaudal sequence at precise developmental time windows. Progressively higher RA signalling is necessary for assigning more posterior territories. Complete RA deficiency results in the caudal hindbrain assuming an r4-like identity, which is postulated to be the hindbrain ground state. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces myeloid differentiation of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, NB4, but does not affect its subclone NB4/RA harboring a point-mutated ligand-binding domain (AF2) in retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene. We found that ATRA induced the 4-fold elevation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity 24 h after treatment in NB4 cells, but not in NB4/RA cells. ATRA did not affect neutral sphingomyelinase activity in either NB4 or NB4/RA. Upon treatment with ATRA, ceramide, the product of an ASMase reaction, accumulated in NB4 cells. Northern blot analysis showed a marked elevation of the ASMase mRNA 8 h after ATRA treatment, reaching a plateau at 24 h. Regulation of ASMase gene expression was studied by a promoter analysis using luciferase reporter assay. The 5'-upstream flanking region of human ASMase gene (-519/+300) conjugated with the luciferase gene was introduced into COS-7 cells. Luciferase activity in transformed cells markedly increased in response to ATRA stimulation when the wild type RARalpha or the PML/RARalpha hybrid protein was co-expressed. Deletion experiments revealed that a short sequence at the 5'-end (-519/-485) was indispensable for the ATRA response. Within this short region, two retinoic acid-responsive element-like motifs (TGCCCG and TCTCCT) and one AP2-like motif (CCCTTCCC) were identified. Deletion and base-substitution experiments showed that all three motifs are required for the full expression induced by ATRA. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays with the nuclear extract of ATRA-treated NB4 cells showed that proteins were bound specifically to the probe being mediated by all three motifs in the promoter sequence. The biosynthesis of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in human placenta involves the actions of aromatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17HSD1). Aromatase, an enzyme complex comprised of P450aromatase (P450arom) and NADH-cytochrome P450 reductase, converts androgens to estrogens, whereas 17HSD1 catalyzes the reduction of estrone to E(2). In the present study, the effects of retinoic acids (RAs) on P450arom and 17HSD1 expression in placental cells were investigated. Treatment with all-trans-RA (at-RA) or 9cis-RA increased E(2) production in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells and cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells isolated from normal early placentas. Meanwhile, the activity of aromatase and expression of P450arom mRNA were induced by at-RA in JEG-3 cells. Northern blot analysis showed that the effect on P450arom mRNA expression occurs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Similar to at-RA and 9cis-RA, Ro40-6055, the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha)-selective activator, increased the expression of P450arom and 17HSD1 mRNA in JEG-3 cells. On the other hand, Ro41-5253 (Ro41), the RARalpha-selective antagonist, blocked the stimulatory effect of RAs on P450arom expression. Surprisingly, Ro41 induced the activity and mRNA expression of 17HSD1 in JEG-3 cells, which is in contrast to the expected inhibitory effect and, moreover, remarkably potentiated the induction by at-RA and 9cis-RA. However, reporter gene analysis revealed that the influence of Ro41 on the transcription of the HSD17B1 gene, which encodes 17HSD1, is considerably milder in JEG-3 cells, and it only additively enhanced the effect of at-RA. Finally, it was found that at-RA and 9cis-RA increased the expression of P450arom and 17HSD1 mRNA in CTB cells, but to a lesser extent. The data suggest that RAs may play a role in promoting the biosynthesis of E(2 )in the placenta. In addition, Ro41 has divergent effects on gene expression in JEG-3 cells. Prostaglandins (PGs) are synthesized in the endometrium. Our objective was to evaluate interleukin (IL)-1alpha-induced production of PGE2 and PGF2alpha in endometrial stromal cells (ESC) following treatment with ceramide analogues. ESC were obtained from human uterine endometrium by enzymic digestion and filtration. ESC were treated with IL-1alpha, IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), C2-ceramide and C6-ceramide. The concentrations of PGE2 and PGF2alpha in media were determined using ELISA. The induction of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS)-2 mRNA was also ascertained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The production of PGE2 and PGF2alpha was significantly increased by IL-lalpha and suppressed by IL-1 ra, in a dose-dependent manner. PGF2alpha production was further increased by treatment with the combination of IL-1alpha and C2-ceramide as compared with IL-1alpha treatment alone. There was no significant difference in PGE2 production between cells treated with IL-1alpha and C2-ceramide and those treated with IL-1alpha alone. Both PGE2 and PGF2alpha production were significantly increased by treatment with IL-1alpha and C6-ceramide as compared with IL-1alpha treatment alone. Treatment of ESC with IL-1alpha stimulated PGHS-2 mRNA. PGHS-2 mRNA was decreased when IL-1 ra was added to the IL-1alpha-stimulated cells. These results suggest that IL-1alpha stimulates the production of PGE2 and PGF2alpha by a mechanism that involves the sphingomyelin-ceramide system, and thus that ceramide may be important in increasing the production of PGE2 and PGF2alpha in the human endometrium. Retinol is stored in liver in the form of its esters. The retinol-esterifying enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) catalyzes the conversion of retinol into its storage form. Expression of the LRAT mRNA is induced by retinoic acid (RA), or by dietary vitamin A, and is downregulated upon vitamin A depletion. RA also induces the expression in liver of the mRNA for CYP26, the enzyme that disposes of excess RA by oxidizing RA to 4-oxo-RA. CYP26 is downregulated upon vitamin A depletion. To study the mechanism of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (TWHF). Chondrocytes from the resected knee joint cartilage of patients with rheumatoid and TWHF, dexamethasone, or (arthritis were isolated and cultured. IL-1 indomethacin of different concentrations were added into the culture solution overnight. Griess reagent was added to the supernatant to detect the content of NO. Chondrocytes were collected to examine the iNOS activity by detecting the conversion of L-14C-arginine into L-14C-citruline. The total RNA of chondrocyte was extracted and the iNOS-mRNA was examined by Northern blotting. The inhibitory rates of NO production by TWHF of concentrations of 2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, and 16 mg/L were 10.8%, 25.48%, 55.17%, and 80.45% respectively. The inhibitory rates of iNOS activity by TWHF of concentrations of 2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, and 16 mg/L were 12.29%, 27.67%, 59.04%, and 85.06% respectively. Such inhibitory effects were dosage-dependent. TWHF ffectively inhibited the expression of iNOS-mRNA induced by IL-1 in chondrocyte (r = 0.976 and 0.974). Dexamethasone inhibited NO production, iNOS activity, and expression of iNOS-mRNA significantly but not dosage-dependently. Indomethcin only had weak inhibitory effect. TWHF inhibits NO production in chondrocytes by limiting the transcription of iNOS gene, which may be one of the mechanisms of treatment of RA with TWHF. Pharmacophore hypotheses were developed for a series of 2,4-diamino-5-deazapteridine inhibitors of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR). Training sets consisting of 20 inhibitors were selected in each case on the basis of the information content of the structures and activity data as required by the HypoGen program in the Catalyst software. In the case of MAC DHFR inhibitors, the best pharmacophore in terms of statistics and predictive value consisted of four features: two hydrogen bond acceptors (HA), one hydrophobic (HY) feature, and one ring aromatic (RA) feature. The selected pharmacophore hypothesis yielded an rms deviation of 0.730 and a correlation coefficient of 0.967 with a cost difference (null cost minus total cost) of approximately 52. The pharmacophore was validated on a large set of test inhibitors. For the test series, a classification scheme was used to distinguish highly active from moderately active and inactive compounds on the basis of activity ranges. This classification scheme is more practical than actual estimated values because these values have no meaning for compounds yet to be tested except that they indicate whether the compounds will be active or inactive in a biological assay. For the training set, the success rate for predicting active and inactive compounds was 100%. For the test set, the success rate in predicting active compounds was greater than 92% while about 7% of the inactive compounds were predicted to be active. This successful prediction was further validated on three structurally diverse compounds active against MAC DHFR. Two compounds mapped well onto three of the four features of the pharmacophore. The third compound was mapped to all four features of the pharmacophore. This validation study provided confidence for the usefulness of the selected pharmacophore model to identify compounds with diverse structures from a database search. Comparison of pharmacophores for inhibitors of human and MAC DHFR is expected to reveal fundamental differences between these two pharmacophores that may be effectively exploited to identify and design compounds with high selectivity for MAC DHFR. Equal expression of X-linked genes such as G6PD and PGK in females and males and the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation are critically dependent on the expression of the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist). The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of in vitro production (IVP) and nuclear transfer (NT) on the relative abundance (RA) of the X-linked transcripts G6PD, PGK, and Xist in preimplantation bovine embryos. In experiment 1, sex-determined IVP or in vivo-produced embryos were analyzed for mRNA expression of the 3 genes. The sex ratio was 36% vs. 64% in IVP blastocysts and thus deviated significantly from the expected ratio of 50% in the vivo control group. The RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly higher in female IVP embryos than in male embryos. In contrast, no significant differences were seen between in vivo-derived female embryos and their male counterparts. At the morula stage, female IVP embryos transcribed significantly more PGK mRNA than did male embryos. However, blastocysts did not exhibit significant differences in PGK transcripts. No differences were observed for in vivo-derived embryos with regard to the RA of PGK transcripts. The RA of Xist mRNA was significantly higher in all female embryos than in their male counterparts. In experiment 2, IVP, in vivo-developed, NT-derived, and parthenogenetic embryos carrying two X chromosomes of either maternal and paternal origin or of maternal origin only (parthenogenotes) were analyzed for the RA of the 3 genes. In NT-derived morulae, the RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly increased compared with their IVP and in vivo-generated counterparts. G6PD transcript levels were significantly increased in IVP blastocysts compared with in vivo-generated and parthenogenetic embryos. At the morula stage, PGK transcripts were similar in all groups, but the RA of PGK transcripts was significantly higher in IVP blastocysts than in their in vivo-generated, parthenogenetic, and NT-derived counterparts. The RA of Xist was significantly elevated in NT-derived morulae compared with IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. NT-derived blastocysts showed an increased Xist expression compared with that of IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. Results of the present study show for the first time that differences in X-chromosome-linked gene transcript levels are related to a perturbed dosage compensation in female and male IVP and female NT-derived embryos. This finding warrants further studies to improve IVP systems and NT protocols to ensure the production of embryos with normal gene expression patterns. The follicular phase (FOL) and pregnancy exhibit increases in uterine blood flow (UBF), estrogen levels, and uterine artery (UA) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. UA branching within the mesometrium increases the total vascular cross-sectional area, which reduces the vascular perfusion pressure gradient, thus locally decreasing the blood flow velocity. Shear stress (SS) activates eNOS and may be associated with UBF elevations during FOL and pregnancy. We hypothesized that regional differences in eNOS responses are observed with both decreases in vessel diameter and during the ovarian cycle and pregnancy. Endothelial isolated proteins were collected from renal (RA) and internal iliac arteries (II) as well as from primary (UA 1 degrees ), secondary (UA 2 degrees), and tertiary (UA 3 degrees) UA branches of nonpregnant luteal phase (LUT; n = 6) and FOL (n = 6) as well as midpregnant (MP; 82 +/- 1 days gestation, n = 6) and late pregnant (LP; 127 +/- 3 days gestation, n = 6) ewes (term = 145 +/- 3 days gestation) for Western blot analysis. LUT RA, II, and UA 1 degrees eNOS levels were similar. There was a 60.7 +/- 9.8% reduction in eNOS expression in UA 2 degrees and UA 3 degrees. A similar decreasing eNOS regional expression gradient was observed in LP ewes. No eNOS regional expression gradient was observed in FOL or MP ewes because eNOS increased in UA 2 degrees and UA 3 degrees. In UA 2 degrees and UA 3 degrees, MP > LP = FOL > LUT. Thus, with increasing UBF, FOL and pregnancy rises in SS may regulate eNOS protein expression in smaller diameter UAs. A decrease in LUT and LP UA 2 degrees and UA 3 degrees endothelial eNOS suggest a possible negative feedback mechanism due to downregulation of eNOS if SS is normalized. We recently cloned the murine homologue of Cyp26B1, a novel retinoic acid (RA)-metabolizing enzyme and showed that its gene expression pattern is unique from that of Cyp26A1 during early embryogenesis. Here, we complete this comparative expression analysis from embryonic day (E) 12 to postnatal stages. Cyp26B1 expression was found in developing tendons and precartilaginous elements and in perichondrium by E14.5, while Cyp26A1 expression was restricted to extremities of rib and vertebral cartilage. Cyp26A1 and Cyp26B1 were expressed, in the distal epithelium and mesenchyme of the limbs and genital tubercle, respectively. High Cyp26B1 expression was found in craniofacial areas undergoing morphogenetic growth, whereas Cyp26A1 message was restricted to the mouth and dental epithelium. Cyp26A1 alone was expressed in the developing neural retina, while both genes were co-expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium. Cyp26B1 was specifically expressed in the developing hindbrain (pons, cerebellum) and forebrain (striatum, hippocampus), with forebrain expression persisting postnatally. In addition, Cyp26B1 was expressed at specific levels of the differentiating upper and lower thoracic spinal cord, adjacent to the cervical and lumbar regions that express the RA-synthesizing enzyme RALDH-2. In viscera, Cyp26B1 transcripts were detected in the developing lung, kidney, spleen, thymus and testis, whereas Cyp26A1 transcripts were found in the diaphragm and outer stomach mesenchyme. Cyp26B1 was also specifically expressed in dermis surrounding the developing hair follicles. Regulated RA metabolism may therefore be required in many developing systems. Three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH1, RALDH2 and RALDH3), which catalyze the oxidation of retinaldehyde into retinoic acid, have been shown to be differentially expressed during early embryogenesis. Here, we report their differential expression patterns throughout later mouse organogenesis. Raldh1 is prominently expressed in developing lung (notably in bronchial and tracheal epithelia), and shows stage-specific expression in stomach and intestine epithelial and mesenchymal layers. Raldh3 expression is specific to the differentiating intestinal lamina propria. Raldh2 is expressed throughout the kidney nephrogenic zone, whereas Raldh1 and Raldh3 are mostly expressed in collecting duct epithelia. Raldh3 expression is more restricted than that of Raldh1 in the urogenital tract and sex gland epithelia, whereas Raldh2 expression is mesenchymal. Raldh1 is coexpressed with Raldh2 in the early heart epicardium, and is later specifically expressed in developing heart valves. All three genes exhibit distinct expression patterns in respiratory and olfactory epithelia and/or mesenchymes, and in developing teeth. Only Raldh1 expression is seen after birth in specific brain structures. These data indicate a requirement for regulated RA synthesis in various differentiating organs. A-57-year-old woman had suffered from high fever, general malaise, and loss of weight (6 kg) since January, 2000. She was admitted to our hospital in May, 2000, because of gait disturbance following to swelling of bilateral calves with severe pain beside the above symptoms. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis (WBC 10,000/microliter), high ESR (98 mm/hr), positive CRP (3.43 mg/dl), positive ANA (x160), high titer of RA (266 IU/l), and a low titer of MPO-ANCA (18 EU). T 2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed intensity area of the M. gastrocnemius. Skin biopsy specimens of the right leg demonstrated necrotizing arteritis of small-sized arteries. These findings supported the diagnosis of limited type of polyarteritis nodosa (PN). In this report, we demonstrate a rare case of PN limited to both calves with characteristic MRI findings and a low titer of MPO-ANCA. To study the possible relationship between the C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the toxicity and efficacy of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genotype analysis of the MTHFR gene was done in 236 patients who started MTX treatment with (n = 157) or without (n = 79) folic or folinic acid supplementation. Outcomes were parameters of efficacy of MTX treatment, patient withdrawal due to adverse events, discontinuation of MTX treatment because of elevated liver enzyme levels, and the total occurrence of elevated liver enzyme levels during the study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the presence of the MTHFR C677T mutation and toxicity outcomes of MTX treatment. Forty-eight percent of the patients showed the homozygous (T/T) or heterozygous (T/C) mutation. The presence of the C677CT or C677TT genotypes was associated with an increased risk of discontinuing MTX treatment because of adverse events (relative risk 2.01; 95% confidence interval 1.09, 3.70), mainly due to an increased risk of elevated liver enzyme levels (relative risk 2.38; 95% confidence interval 1.06, 5.34). Efficacy parameters were not significantly different between the patients with and those without the mutation. The C677T mutation is the first identified genetic risk factor for elevated alanine aminotransferase values during MTX treatment in patients with RA. We postulate that the incidence of clinically important elevation of liver enzyme levels during MTX treatment is mediated by homocysteine metabolism. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid reduced the risk of toxicity-related discontinuation of MTX treatment both in patients with and in patients without the mutation. The extraction method for beta-glucosidase from green vanilla beans has been studied. The effect of storage of green beans and protein extracts on beta-glucosidase and peroxidase activity was investigated: the best method, resulting in the highest enzyme activities, particularly for glucosidase, was through extraction of very fresh green beans in the presence of BisTris propane buffer at pH 8. The best method for storage of the extracts was at -80 degrees C after addition of 15% glycerol, when over 90% of initial activity was still present. Peroxidase activity did not change in frozen beans or in frozen extracts. The great variability of slow acetylator (SA) and/or rapid acetylator (RA) frequency is mainly due to ethnic-racial origin. Using the urinary elimination ratio of three metabolites of caffeine--acetylamino formylamino methyluracil (AFMU) to AFMU + 1-methyl urate (1U) + 1-methyl xanthine (1X)--we settled the acetylation phenotype in 54 independent subjects of Khmer and 70 independent subjects of Caucasian origin. Using DNA from peripheral leucocytes, we determined by PCR, in 32 Khmer and 122 Caucasian subjects, the frequencies of wild-type alleles (NAT-2 *4) and of mutated alleles (NAT-2 *5A, *6A, *7A). The frequency of SA was respectively 28 per cent and 61 per cent in Khmer and Caucasian subjects. The antimode of the distribution of the ratio was different in the two populations: 0.07 in Khmers and 0.18 in Caucasians showing a reduced acetylation capacity in the Khmer population in spite of a higher frequency of RA. The frequencies of alleles were also different between the two populations. Between Khmers and Caucasians respectively: *4: 48.4-23.8 per cent *5A: 15.6-44.2 per cent. *6A: 29.7-32.0 per cent. *7A: 6.3-0 per cent. These differences might be taken into account to define a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of tuberculosis by isoniazide. Gastroenteropathy is the most common among patients who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. It is known that rheumatoid arthritic (RA) patients are more susceptible to NSAID-induced gastropathy than other NSAID users. This article reviewed our recent studies concerning the influence of arthritis on gastric mucosal integrity in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. The gastric mucosal lesions induced by indomethacin, one of conventional NSAIDs, were markedly aggravated in arthritic rats. Likewise, the healing of chronic gastric ulcers induced by thermal cauterization was significantly delayed in arthritic rats. The underlying mechanisms of these phenomena observed in arthritic rats may be attributable to the enhancement of iNOS/NO pathway in the former and the less expression of various growth factors in the ulcerated mucosa, such as basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF) or insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) in the latter. In addition, we recently found that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors, such as rofecoxib or celecoxib, induced apparent gastric lesions in arthritic rats, suggesting that a caution should be paid on the use of COX-2 selective inhibitors in RA patients. The tissue distribution of retinoic acid (RA) throughout development is highly restricted, defined by the expression patterns of enzymes involved in RA synthesis and catabolism. Presented is a summary of recent research that examines the role of some of the enzymes involved in RA distribution, particularly those involved in RA catabolism (P450RAI). These latter enzymes protect against premature exposure to RA, and the implications of these findings are discussed. To investigate nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible NO synthase expression by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Eighteen patients with SSc were compared with two control groups: 16 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 23 patients with mechanical sciatica. Nitrate was determined by fluorimetry in plasma and by spectrophotometry in supernatants. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was detected in cultured PBMC by immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and flow cytometry with or without treatment of the cells with interleukin (IL) 1beta+ tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-4 or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) from day 1 to day 5. NO metabolite concentrations were lower in SSc patients (mean+/-s.e.m. 34.3+/-2.63 micromol/l) than in RA (48.3+/-2.82 micromol/l; P<0.02) and sciatica (43.3+/-5.24 micromol/l; P<0.03) patients. iNOS was detected in cultured monocytes in all three groups but induction occurred on day 1 in RA, day 2 in sciatica and only on day 3 in SSc, whatever the stimulus. The concentrations of NO metabolites are decreased in SSc patients and the metabolism of these compounds in PBMC is altered. Low levels of NO, a vasodilator, may be involved in vasospasm, which is critical in SSc. This may have therapeutic implications. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immediately expressed in neuronal and glial cells under various stressful conditions and play a protective role through molecular chaperones. We investigated the characteristics of the induction manner of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and HSP70 in rat C6 glioblastoma cells. In heat treatment (42 degrees C for 30 min), C6 cells expressed high level of HO-1 and HSP70 mRNAs within 30-60 min, and their proteins at 3 hrs. Heat-induced expressions of HSPs mRNAs were completely inhibited with actinomycin D, suggesting the transcriptional regulation. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), cystine-free (inhibition of synthesis of glutathione), cyto-toxic (ethanol, sodium butyrate) treatments resulted in different expression manners between HO-1 and HSP70, which suggested that HO-1 and HSP70 play different protective roles against a variety kind of stressful conditions in glial cells. C6 cells can differentiate toward both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte directions. Treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP) induces expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, and treatment with retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), a marker of oligodendrocytes, respectively. Heat treatment before the initiation of differentiation by RA reduced the RA-induced expression of PLP mRNA profoundly, but not in GFAP mRNA level induced by cAMP. Heat treatment after the initiation of differentiation by cAMP or RA accelerated the expression of GFAP or PLP mRNAs. Astroglial differentiation by cAMP reduced the heat-induced expressions of HSPs mRNAs, but no change with RA pre-treatment. These results suggested that HSPs may modulate the glial differentiation in the developing brain. On the contrary, glial differentiation may give influence on the stress-induced HSPs expression. The timing of stressful damages, resulting in the expression of HSPs, on the developing brain is critically important for the pathogenesis of glial lesion. In the heat-treated C6 cells, the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-alpha mRNA was significantly decreased. HSPs may have ability to induce the glial differentiation in part through down-regulation of the PDGF pathway. Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) compete for the same substrate, L-arginine. The reciprocal regulation of arginase and NOS in L-arginine-metabolizing pathways has recently been demonstrated. Since NOS is involved in the inflammation of human arthritides, we hypothesized that this reciprocal regulation might also occur within the inflamed synovium. The present study shows that both serum arginase activity and protein levels were significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or osteoarthritis (OA) or in healthy controls. Arginase protein concentrations in supernatants of monocyte cultures from RA patients were also significantly higher than in those from SLE or OA patients or healthy controls. In RA patients, there was a significant correlation between the serum concentrations of arginase protein and rheumatoid factor (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). These data indicate that increased arginase production is seen in RA patients, but not in other immune-related diseases, suggesting that increased arginase production is unique to, and may play an important role in, the pathogenesis of RA disease. Various extracts of the Chinese herbal remedy Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (TWHF) have been reported to be therapeutically efficacious in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China, but their mechanism of action remains unclear. We investigated the effect of triptolide, a diterpenoid triepoxide from TWHF, on the production of pro-matrix metalloproteinase 1 (proMMP-1; or procollagenase 1 or pro-interstitial collagenase 1), proMMP-3 (or prostromelysin 1), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and proinflammatory cytokines in human synovial fibroblasts and J774A.1 mouse macrophages. Human synovial fibroblasts and mouse macrophages were cultured with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of triptolide. The production of proMMPs 1 and 3, TIMPs 1 and 2, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1beta, and IL-6 was assayed by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene expression of proMMPs 1 and 3, TIMPs 1 and 2, COX-1 and COX-2, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and IL-6 was also monitored by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Triptolide suppressed the IL-1alpha-induced production of proMMPs 1 and 3 and decreased their messenger RNA levels in human synovial fibroblasts. In contrast, the IL-1alpha-induced gene expression and production of TIMPs 1 and 2 were further augmented by triptolide in the synovial cells. Triptolide also inhibited the IL-1alpha-induced production of PGE2 by selectively suppressing the gene expression and production of COX-2, but not those of COX-1. In addition, triptolide suppressed the LPS-induced production of PGE2 in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the gene expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IL-6, as well as the production of IL-1beta and IL-6, were inhibited by triptolide in the LPS-treated mouse macrophages. We have demonstrated for the first time that the therapeutic effects of TWHF in RA are due in part to the novel chondroprotective effect of triptolide via the direct suppression of the production of proMMPs 1 and 3 and the simultaneous up-regulation of TIMPs in IL-1-treated synovial fibroblasts. Triptolide's interference with gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and its known inhibitory effects on PGE2 production are also probably very effective. Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist used in several chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Pulmonary toxicity occurs in 0.5% to 14% of patients receiving low-dose MTX. Manifestations of pulmonary toxicity are protean and include parenchymal inflammation, pneumonia, airway hyperreactivity, air trapping and possibly neoplasm. We performed an exhaustive review of the English literature and identified 189 cases of methotrexate-induced pneumonitis (MIP). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was the most frequent underlying disease. In most patients, symptoms present subacutely with progression over several weeks. Most patients present with dyspnea, dry cough, fever, and bibasilar crackles. Peripheral eosinophilia has been cited in one third of cases. The chest radiograph may be normal, but more commonly reveals bilateral interstitial or mixed, interstitial and alveolar infiltrates with a predilection for the bases. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrate ground-glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates, septal lines or widespread consolidation. Pulmonary function studies reveal a restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be helpful in ruling out an infectious etiology and in supporting the diagnosis of MIP. Cellular interstitial infiltrates, granulomas, fibrosis, atypical epithelial cells, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) are the main histologic features. Once MIP is suspected, the MTX should be withdrawn. Corticosteroids may accelerate resolution and are recommended in severe or fulminant cases. The prognosis of MIP is usually favorable, but occasionally the outcome may be fatal. Retinoic acid (RA) is the form of vitamin A that controls differentiation and proliferation of epithelia. Our previous work established that normal breast epithelia synthesize RA from retinol, an ability retained by three immortalized but nontumorigenic cell lines but lost in five of six breast cell lines. In this work, we characterize the cause of this defect in one of the lines, the MCF-7 line. We have determined that the immortalized but nontumorigenic cell line, MTSV1.7, capable of synthesizing RA from both retinol and retinal, contains a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity for the second step in RA biosynthesis. We have identified it, after isolation, as a previously described enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 (ALDH6). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human breast with antibodies to ALDH6 showed expression of this enzyme in the glandular epithelia colocalized with cellular RA-binding protein type II, a possible marker for certain cells able to synthesize RA. ALDH6 was not present in MCF-7 cells, and these cells were unable to oxidize retinal to RA in culture. When MCF-7 cells were then transfected with ALDH6, they (re)gained the ability to oxidize retinal to RA as well as some ability to synthesize RA when provided with retinol. This suggests that loss of ALDH6 expression is the defect in RA biosynthesis in these cells. Identification of ALDH6 as the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase present in normal human breast epithelia provides the first tool necessary for studying the loss of RA synthetic ability in cancer cells and the relationship of this process to malignant transformation. Vitamin A and its active metabolite retinoic acid (RA) modulate host-pathogen interactions by interfering with the host immune and inflammatory response including prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. The effects of RA on phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms in vitro are controversial, and few in vivo studies exist. We investigated the in vivo effects of RA on PG biosynthesis in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. RA alone [10 mg/(kg. d) for 5 d] increased plasma and liver PG concentrations by increasing COX-1 protein expression (twofold that of control rats). RA acted synergistically with LPS to increase plasma (400-fold) and liver (15-fold) concentrations of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and significantly, but to a lesser extent, other PG compared with RA rats, in the absence of major differences in PLA(2) expression or activity or COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA or protein expression. The RA + LPS-mediated increase in PGE(2) was significantly attenuated (97%) by aminoguanidine (AG), a relatively specific inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), consistent with the previously reported synergistic effect of RA and LPS on NOS2 expression and activity. In addition, RA and LPS induced the expression of the microsomal isoform of PGE synthase (mPGES). In conclusion, in vivo, RA and LPS increased PG and especially PGE(2) concentrations. The PGE(2) increase was associated with NOS2-mediated activation of COX and induction of mPGES. These results contribute to the characterization of the effects of vitamin A on the host inflammatory response. When normal-lived Ra strain Drosophila were indirectly selected for longevity, they gave rise to long-lived La strain animals with lower oxidized protein and lipid levels that were temporally coincident with higher antioxidant activities. We wanted to determine whether it was possible to create long-lived animals by a direct selection for increased antioxidant activities. Using the same Ra strain, we selected them over 24 generations for increased resistance to paraquat. Selection was successful: the paraquat-resistant flies had a fourfold increase in their LT(50) (mean lethal time) values. Their extended longevity pattern differs from that of the La strain. The paraquat-resistant animals also have a lower level of antioxidant activity, an increased total P450 enzyme activity level, an altered pattern of energy metabolism, and a significantly lower developmental viability. We interpret these findings as suggesting that similar stress response phenotypes may be generated by different molecular mechanisms, some of which may generate very different types of extended longevity phenotypes. Retinoic acid (RA), the biologically active derivative of vitamin A, induces a variety of embryonal carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines to differentiate into neurons. The molecular events underlying this process are reviewed with a view to determining whether these data can lead to a better understanding of the normal process of neuronal differentiation during development. Several transcription factors, intracellular signaling molecules, cytoplasmic proteins, and extracellular molecules are shown to be necessary and sufficient for RA-induced differentiation. The evidence that RA is an endogenous component of the developing central nervous system (CNS) is then reviewed, data which include high-pressure liquid chromotography (HPLC) measurements, reporter systems and the distribution of the enzymes that synthesize RA. The latter is particularly relevant to whether RA signals in a paracrine fashion on adjacent tissues or whether it acts in an autocrine manner on cells that synthesize it. It seems that a paracrine system may operate to begin early patterning events within the developing CNS from adjacent somites and later within the CNS itself to induce subsets of neurons. The distribution of retinoid-binding proteins, retinoid receptors, and RA-synthesizing enzymes is described as well as the effects of knockouts of these genes. Finally, the effects of a deficiency and an excess of RA on the developing CNS are described from the point of view of patterning the CNS, where it seems that the hindbrain is the most susceptible part of the CNS to altered levels of RA or RA receptors and also from the point of view of neuronal differentiation where, as in the case of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, RA promotes neuronal differentiation. The crucial roles played by certain genes, particularly the Hox genes in RA-induced patterning processes, are also emphasized. To assess the role of bone marrow in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we examined the capacity of CD34(+) cells from bone marrow to generate fibroblast-like type B synoviocytes. CD34(+) cells from the bone marrow of 22 RA patients differentiated into cells with fibroblast-like morphology, which expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase, in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), much more effectively than CD34(+) cells from bone marrow of 15 control subjects (10 patients with osteoarthritis and 5 healthy individuals). The generation of fibroblast-like cells was not at all observed in cultures with SCF, GM-CSF, and interleukin 4 (IL-4) with or without TNF-alpha. Generation of fibroblast-like cells was correlated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 levels in culture supernatants. Thus, MMP-1 levels were significantly higher in TNF-alpha-stimulated cultures of bone marrow CD34(+) cells from patients with RA than in those from the control group. These results indicate that bone marrow CD34(+) cells from patients with RA have abnormal capacities to respond to TNF-alpha and to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells producing MMP-1, suggesting that bone marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells might generate type B synoviocytes and thus could play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Tight regulation of retinoic acid (RA) distribution in the embryo is critical for normal morphogenesis. The RA-metabolizing enzymes Cyp26A1 and Cyp26B1 are believed to play important roles in protecting certain embryonic tissues from inappropriate RA signaling. We have cloned the murine Cyp26B1 cDNA and compared its expression pattern to that of Cyp26A1 from embryonic day (E) E7-E11.5 using in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis shows the presence of two Cyp26B1 transcripts of approximately 2.3 and 3.5 kb in embryonic limb bud. Whereas Cyp26A1 is expressed in gastrulating embryos by E7, Cyp26B1 is first expressed at E8.0 in prospective rhombomeres 3 and 5. Cyp26B1 expression expands to specific dorso-ventral locations in rhombomeres 2-6 between E8.5 and E9.5, whereas Cyp26A1 hindbrain expression is limited to rhombomere 2 at E8.5. No (or very weak) Cyp26B1 expression is observed in the tail bud, a major site of Cyp26A1 expression. Differential expression is seen in branchial arches, with Cyp26A1 being mainly expressed in neural crest-derived mesenchyme, and Cyp26B1 in specific ectodermal and endodermal areas. Cyp26B1 is markedly expressed in the ectoderm and distal mesoderm of the limb buds from the beginning of their outgrowth. Cyp26A1 transcripts are seen later and at lower levels in limb ectoderm, and both transcripts are excluded from the apical ectodermal ridge. The effects of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) on melanogenesis and the mechanism of its action in topical treatment have not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of RA on melanogenesis in the pigmented skin equivalent as well as in monolayer culture of melanocytes, and to determine whether RA, hydroquinone (HQ), and hydrocortisone (HC) show synergistic depigmenting effects in combined treatments of each other. The suppressing effect of RA on melanogenesis was not observed in pigmented skin equivalents and monolayer culture of murine and human melanocytes, although HQ showed strong inhibition of melanogenesis. The synergistic effects between RA, HQ, and HC were not particularly seen. The results suggested that RA neither has direct inhibitory effects on melanogenesis of melanocytes, nor influences the cell-cell interactions between melanocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, such as paracrine actions with regard to melanin production. The role of RA in bleaching treatments appears to be in other specific actions, such as promotion of keratinocytes proliferation and acceleration of epidermal turnover. Infrared pulse laser therapy was studied for its impact on the production of active forms of oxygen and nitrogen by neutrophils from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors determined the non-activated and PMA-activated production of superoxide anion-radical, peroxynitrite, peripheral neurophilic NAD.PH-oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, and the red blood cell concentrations of reduced glutathione. Before therapy, non-activation RA neurophilic production of superoxide was much higher than in donors. Laser therapy made this parameter normal. Similarly, neutrophilic peroxynitrite production (defined by dihydrorhodamine oxidation) in RA patients was 1.7 times higher than the normal values. IF-laser therapy decreased peroxynitrite production to the values observed in donors. It is important that the therapy caused increased SOD activity (that was lower in RA patients prior to therapy) up to apparently control values. Thus, IF-laser therapy has a certain antioxidative effect by increasing SOD activity in RA patients' blood cells and reducing the production of highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen forms. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (RALDH-2) is a major retinoic acid (RA) generating enzyme in the embryo. Here, we report immunolocalization of this enzyme (RALDH-2-IR) in the developing wings of stage 17-30 chicken embryos. RALDH-2-IR is located in the area of the presumptive muscle masses, although it is not colocalized with developing muscle cells. RALDH-2-IR is located in tendon precursor cells and may be present in muscular connective tissue. We show that motor neurons and blood vessels, tissues showing RALDH-2-IR as they enter the limb, are capable of synthesizing and releasing RA in culture. RALDH-2-IR in the limb mesenchyme is under the control of both the vasculature and the motor innervation; it is decreased with denervation and increased with hypervascularization. RALDH-2-IR is present in the motor neuron pool of the brachial spinal cord, but this expression pattern is apparently not under the control of limb target tissues, RA in the periphery, or somitic factors. RA is known to be a potent inducer of cellular differentiation; we propose that locally synthesized RA may be involved in aspects of wing tissue specification, including cartilage condensation and outgrowth, skeletal muscle differentiation, and recruitment of smooth muscle cells to the vasculature. Prostaglandins (PG) are known to play important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of leukaemia cells. The effect of the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of PG, on the proliferation and differentiation of leukaemia cell lines was investigated. COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and nabumetone, suppressed the proliferation of U-937 and ML-1 cells by inducing a G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest. Cell-cycle arrest induced by these COX-2 inhibitors was not associated with an upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. COX-2 inhibitors also inhibited the differentiation of these cells induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and retinoic acid (RA). Treatment with NS-398 did not suppress the levels of PGs produced by these cells. Although COX-2 antisense oligonucleotide showed a similar inhibitory effect on these cells, its inhibitory effect was smaller than that of NS-398. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may suppress the proliferation and differentiation of leukaemia cells both via COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways. We investigated nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Eighteen patients with SSc were compared to two control groups: 16 rheumatoid arthritis patients (RA) and 23 mechanical sciatica patients. The sum of nitrites and nitrates was determined by fluorimetry in sera and spectrophotometry in supernatants. Inducible iNOS was detected in cultured PBMC by immunofluorescence, immunoblot and flow cytometry with or without IL-1 beta + TNF alpha, IL-4 or IFN gamma from day 1 to day 5. NO metabolite concentrations in the plasma were lower in SSc (34.3 mumol/l +/- 2.63 SEM) than in RA (48.3 mumol/l +/- 2.2; p < 0.02) and sciatica (43.3 mumol/l +/- 5.24; p < 0.03) patients. iNOS was detected in cultured monocytes in the 3 groups but induction occurred on day 1 in RA, day 2 in sciatica and only on day 3 in SSc, whatever the stimulus. The concentrations of NO metabolites are decreased in SSc patients and the induction of iNOS in PBMC is delayed. Low levels of NO, a vasodilator, may be involved in vasospasm, which is critical in SSc. This may suggest therapeutic implications. In songbirds, the size of brain nuclei that control song learning and production change seasonally. These changes are mainly controlled by seasonal changes in plasma testosterone (T) concentration. One hypothesis to explain why it may be adaptive for these areas to regress in the fall is that this would decrease the metabolic demand of maintaining a large song system when singing is reduced or absent. We used a marker for cellular metabolism to examine birds with regressed song nuclei and compared them to birds whose song nuclei were induced to grow by administration of exogenous T. Photorefractory male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows were captured during their autumnal migration and kept in outdoor aviaries on a natural photoperiod. We implanted birds with Silastic capsules containing T or with empty implants. Three weeks later the birds were sacrificed. We assayed the brains for cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity and measured the volume of four song nuclei: HVc, RA, 1MAN, and area X. All four nuclei increased in volume in response to T treatment. T treatment increased the metabolic capacity of area X, HVc, and RA relative to surrounding tissue but had no effect on the metabolic capacity of 1MAN. These results support the hypothesis that song nuclei are more metabolically active under the influence of T than they are when plasma T levels are low. In the present study, we examined whether the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) gp120 coat protein can modulate corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) secretion by using the incubation of rat hypothalamic explants as an in vitro model. Treatment of the hypothalamic fragments with recombinant gp120 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in CRF release. The maximal dose of 10 nM gp120 increased CRF release by 56.4% after 1 h, and 78.4% after 3 h, as compared with their respective controls. The intra-hypothalamic amount of CRF was also increased by 54.7% and 77.3% vs. controls after 1 and 3 h, respectively. Moreover, the action of gp120 was blocked by pretreatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that the viral protein modulates CRF secretion via an increase in its synthesis. We also investigated the effects of gp120 on CRF gene expression. RNase protection analyses of total RNA isolated from the explants indicated that 10 nM gp120 significantly increases CRF mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, gp120 did not modify CRF mRNA stability, suggesting that the viral protein modulates CRF gene expression at the transcriptional level. Analysis of the mechanisms that mediate gp120-induced CRF synthesis was conducted. The incubation of the explants with recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) type I receptor antagonist (hrIL-1 ra) did not antagonize the actions of gp120 at 1 and 3 h, indicating that the effect of the latter is independent of IL-1 mediated mechanisms. The involvement of some second messenger pathways was also investigated. Specific inhibitors of cAMP-PKA, cyclo-oxygenase or heme oxygenase pathways failed to antagonize the gp120-induced increase in CRF production. By contrast, incubation with nonselective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), L-NAME and L-NNA, or aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of inducible NOS (iNOS), blocked CRF release and, AG, its mRNA accumulation, stimulated by gp120, whereas selective inhibitors of endothelial and neuronal NOS had no effect. In addition, only L-NAME, L-NNA and AG were able to inhibit the gp120-stimulated production of nitrites. These results indicate that gp120 directly stimulates CRF gene expression and peptide synthesis from the rat hypothalamus in vitro via the activation of iNOS. Therefore, the actions of this viral protein on the HPA axis may, in part, reflect its ability to modulate CRF synthesis. Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a pivotal signal in the regulation of neuroendocrine function and fertility. Although much of the action of leptin in the control of the reproductive axis is exerted at the hypothalamic level, some direct effects of leptin on male and female gonads have also been reported. Indeed, recent evidence demonstrated that leptin is able to inhibit testosterone secretion at the testicular level. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear. The focus of this study was twofold: (1) to identify potential targets for leptin-induced inhibition of steroidogenesis, and (2) to characterize in detail the pattern of expression and cellular distribution of leptin receptor (Ob-R) mRNA in adult rat testis. In pursuit of the first goal, slices of testicular tissue from adult rats were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant leptin (10(-9)--10(-7 )M) in the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 10 IU/ml). In this setting, testosterone secretion in vitro was monitored, and expression levels of mRNAs encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450 scc) and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type III (17 beta-HSD) were assessed by Northern hybridization. In pursuit of the second goal, the pattern of cellular expression of the Ob-R gene in adult rat testis was evaluated by in situ hybridization using a riboprobe complementary to all Ob-R isoforms. In addition, testicular expression levels of the different Ob-R isoforms, previously identified in the hypothalamus, were analyzed by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In keeping with our previous data, recombinant leptin significantly inhibited hCG-stimulated testosterone secretion. In this context, leptin, in a dose-dependent manner, was able to co-ordinately decrease the hCG-stimulated expression levels of SF-1, StAR and P450 scc mRNAs, but it did not affect those of 17 beta-HSD type III. In situ hybridization analysis showed a scattered pattern of cellular expression of the Ob-R gene within the adult rat testis, including Leydig and Sertoli cells. In addition, assessment of the pattern of expression of Ob-R subtypes revealed that the long Ob-Rb isoform was abundantly expressed in adult rat testis. However, variable levels of expression of Ob-Ra, Ob-Re, and Ob-Rf mRNAs were also detected, whereas those of the Ob-Rc variant were nearly negligible. In conclusion, our results indicate that decreased expression of mRNAs encoding several up-stream elements in the steroidogenic pathway may contribute, at least partially, to leptin-induced inhibition of testicular steroidogenesis. In addition, our data on the pattern of testicular expression of Ob-R isoforms and cellular distribution of Ob-R mRNA may help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of leptin action in rat testis. Retinoid binding proteins and nuclear receptors are expressed in the developing mouse inner ear. Here, we report that the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) gene, whose product is involved in the enzymatic generation of retinoic acid (RA), exhibits a restricted expression pattern during mouse inner ear ontogenesis. The Raldh2 gene is first expressed at embryonic day (E) 10.5 in a V-shaped medio-dorsal region of the otocyst outer epithelium, which evolves as two separate domains upon otocyst morphogenesis. At E14.5, Raldh2 is expressed in two areas of the utricle epithelium and specific regions of the saccule and cochlear mesenchyme. Later, Raldh2 transcripts are restricted to two cochlear areas, the stria vascularis and Reissner membrane. Raldh2 mesenchymal expression did not correlate with migrating neural crest-derived melanoblasts. These restricted expression domains may correspond to specific sites of RA synthesis during inner ear morphogenesis. Multiple studies indicate that quantitative control of the levels of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in the vertebrate embryo is necessary for correct development. The function of RA in cells is regulated by a number of coordinated mechanisms. One of those mechanisms involves controls on the rate of RA catabolism. Recently, enzymes capable of catabolizing RA were found to constitute a new family, called CYP26, within the cytochrome P450 superfamily. CYP26 homologues have been isolated from human, mouse, zebra fish, and recently from the chick. In this study, we examined the regulation of chicken CYP26 (cCYP26) expression by RA during the early phase of chick limb outgrowth. In the anterior limb mesenchyme and apical ectodermal ridge (AER), cCYP26 expression was induced in a concentration dependent manner by implanting beads soaked in 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/ml RA. The RA-induced expression of cCYP26 in anterior limb mesenchyme and the AER was detected as early as 1 hr after treatment and was not affected by the presence of cycloheximide. In contrast to the anterior limb, the induction of cCYP26 was dramatically reduced (or absent) when RA beads were implanted in the posterior limb mesenchyme. Furthermore, induction of cCYP26 expression in the anterior mesenchyme was inhibited by transplantations of the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and by Shh-soaked beads. Our data suggest that different mechanisms regulate retinoid homeostasis in the AER and mesenchyme during limb bud outgrowth. J. Exp. Zool. 290:136-147, 2001. Oxidation of D-galactose mediated by D-galactose oxidase [EC 1.1.3.9] gave a dialdehyde that occurs as two bicyclic structures in aqueous solution as established by 13C labeling and NMR spectroscopy. The dialdehyde is very reactive at basic pH leading to complex reaction mixtures. A comparison was made with glutaraldehyde to assess its potential as protein cross-linker. Neutrophils are prominent participants in the joint inflammation of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but the extent of their role in the inductive phase of joint inflammation is unknown. In the K/BxN mouse RA model, transfer of autoreactive Ig from the K/BxN mouse into mice induces a rapid and profound joint-specific inflammatory response reminiscent of human RA. We observed that after K/BxN serum transfer, the earliest clinical signs of inflammation in the ankle joint correlated with the presence of neutrophils in the synovial regions of recipient mouse ankle joints. In this study, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the early inflammatory response to transferred arthritogenic serum from the K/BxN transgenic mouse. Mice were treated with a neutrophil-depleting mAb before and following transfer of arthritogenic serum and scored for clinical indications of inflammation and severity of swelling in ankle joints and front paws. In the absence of neutrophils, mice were completely resistant to the inflammatory effects of K/BxN serum. Importantly, depletion of neutrophils in diseased recipient mice up to 5 days after serum transfer reversed the inflammatory reaction in the joints. Transfer of serum into mice deficient in the generation of nitrogen or oxygen radicals (inducible NO synthase 2 or gp91(phox) genes, respectively) gave normal inflammatory responses, indicating that neither pathway is essential for disease induction. These studies have identified a critical role for neutrophils in initiating and maintaining inflammatory processes in the joint. We have shown earlier that the IFN-beta and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) combination, but not the single agents, induces death in several tumor cell lines. Employing a genetic technique we have identified several Genes associated with Retinoid-IFN induced Mortality (GRIM). One of the GRIMs was human thioredoxin reductase (TR), a redox enzyme. Since the overexpressed TR augments IFN/RA stimulated cell death, we explored the mechanisms of TR-mediated death. Here we show that TR augments cell death by upregulating the transcriptional activity of p53 tumor suppressor. This process does not involve a physical increase in levels of p53. Using redox inactive mutants of TR and its substrate, thioredoxin (Trx), we demonstrate that IFN/RA-induced regulation of p53 dependent gene expression requires TR and Trx. In contrast-over-expression of wildtype TR or Trx augment the p53 dependent gene expression in response to IFN/RA treatment. Consistent with these results an increased DNA binding activity of p53 was noted in the presence of TR. These studies identify a novel mechanism of p53 mediated cell death regulation involving redox enzymes. Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are together with prostanoids, leukotrienes and proteases, believed to be the mediators of inflammation and responsible for the pathogenesis of tissue destruction in RA. Antioxidant (AO) activity is one of the mechanisms by which many conventional drugs used in day to day treatment of RA alleviate the painful symptoms associated with this disease. An investigation has been carried out to compare the antioxidant potentials of two polyherbal formulations, Maharasnadhi quathar (MRQ) and Weldehi choornaya (WC), used by Ayurvedic medical practitioners in Sri-Lanka for the treatment of RA patients. AO potentials of these preparations were assessed by their effects in RA patients on: (a) activities of the AO enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase; (b) lipid peroxidation (as estimated by thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) generation); and (c) concentrations of serum iron and haemoglobin (Hb), and the total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The overall results of the study demonstrate that MRQ has much greater AO potential than WC. Thus, on treatment with MRQ for 3 months, the initial activities of plasma SOD, GPX and catalase, were enhanced by 44.6, 39.8 and 25.2%, respectively. There was no significant improvement in any of these enzyme activities in patients treated with WC for the same time period as MRQ. Although the extent of lipid peroxidation in plasma of RA patients could be decreased by both drug preparations, the reduction mediated in 3 months by MRQ (34%) was markedly greater than that due to WC (21.8%). The total serum iron and Hb concentrations and TIBC in the RA patients included in the study could be significantly improved by treatment with MRQ but not by WC. Thus, at the end of 3 months treatment with MRQ, concentrations of the total serum iron and Hb, and the TIBC of patients improved by 26.8, 24.8 and 16.1%, respectively. Possible reasons for differences in the AO potentials of MRQ and WC are discussed. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR) are effective chemopreventive agents against epithelial tumors in the oral cavity, breast, and prostate. We tested the inhibitory activity of these retinoids against N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced tumorigenesis in the rat esophagus. Male Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to receive diets either lacking or containing 9-cis-RA or 4-HPR for 1 week before tumor initiation with NMBA and then for the duration of the study. NMBA metabolism, O(6)-methylguanine adduct formation, and cytochrome P450 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the esophagi of the rats were studied to investigate the mechanisms by which dietary 4-HPR affects tumorigenesis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Dietary 4-HPR resulted in a dose-dependent and statistically significant enhancement (P<.05) of tumorigenesis in response to NMBA. In two different tumor bioassays, the mean tumor multiplicity for rats fed the highest concentration of dietary 4-HPR (0.8 g/kg diet) was increased by 5.9 tumors (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 10.1 tumors) and 6.7 tumors (95% CI = 5.6 to 7.8 tumors) compared with the mean tumor multiplicity for rats that received the control diet lacking 4-HPR. Animals fed diets containing 9-cis-RA displayed no statistically significant increase in tumorigenesis. Compared with animals fed a diet lacking 4-HPR, animals fed 4-HPR had increased NMBA metabolism in esophageal explant cultures and had higher levels of O(6)-methylguanine DNA adducts and CYP2A3 mRNA in their esophagi. Dietary 4-HPR enhances tumorigenesis in response to NMBA in the rat esophagus by increasing tumor initiation events. Dietary 4-HPR may exert paradoxical effects at some sites, such as the aerodigestive tract, by modulating the bioactivation of carcinogens in target tissues. Nitric oxide (NO) production is essential for normal immunity. We have examined the capacity of retinoic acid (RA), a pleiotropic hormone necessary for normal immunity, to modulate NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. NO production induced by suboptimal concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was significantly greater in cells cultured in low-retinoid medium and treated with all-trans-RA (10(-10) - 10(-6) M, P <0.05), as well as with 9-cis-RA and several retinoids selective for the RA receptor subfamily of nuclear retinoid receptors. Similar results were obtained with lipopolysaccharide and monophosphoryl lipid A as stimuli. The RA-potentiated production of NO was positively correlated with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein (r =0.94, P <0.002), although the expression of iNOS mRNA was not altered. We hypothesize that modulation of the macrophage response to suboptimal immune stimuli by physiological concentrations of RA, as observed in these studies, may be important in establishing an optimal balance between T helper (Th) 1- and Th2-mediated immunity. Gold(I)-containing compounds have long been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the molecular mechanism of their action has remained largely unknown. In this paper we have demonstrated that gold(I) drugs selectively activate the DNA binding of a heterodimer consisting of the basic-leucine zipper transcription factors Nrf2 and small Maf. Once bound to its recognition DNA sequence termed antioxidant-responsive element or Maf-recognition element, Nrf2/small Maf induces a set of antioxidative stress genes, including heme oxygenase-1 and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, whose products have been demonstrated to contribute to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings suggest that stimulation of antioxidative stress response through activation of Nrf2/small Maf may be a pharmacologically important part of the actions of gold(I) drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Alternatively, activation of Nrf2/small Maf may be a protective response of cells against toxic effects of the drugs. Two novel exons, named exon 1A and exon 2A, were found at 18.4 and 12.6 kb upstream from the exon known as the first exon of human FcepsilonRI alpha-chain gene. Transcription from the promoter present in the upstream of exon 1A was decreased by mutations introduced into the "first intron" between exon 1A and exon 2A, suggesting the presence of an intronic regulatory element in the intron. Consistent with this, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed the presence of a nuclear factor which bound the region in FcepsilonRI alpha-chain positive cells. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine with known actions in macrophage and T cell activation. MIF also has the unique capacity to reverse the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on these cells. We have recently demonstrated MIF expression in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), as well as the ability of FLS-derived MIF to induce monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor alpha. We investigated the effects of MIF on aspects of RA FLS activation, including the induction of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX). PLA2 activity was measured by 3H-arachidonic acid released from treated FLS supernatants. COX activity was measured by prostaglandin E2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and COX-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) were determined using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive PLA2 activity was detected in RA FLS. Recombinant human MIF up-regulated PLA2 activity (P < 0.01) and cPLA2 mRNA expression, but had no effect on secretory PLA2. Recombinant human MIF up-regulated COX activity (P < 0.05) and COX-2 mRNA, but had no observable effect on COX-1. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) significantly up-regulated PLA2 activity (P < 0.005) and cPLA2 mRNA expression while anti-MIF monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly inhibited this IL-1beta-induced PLA2 activity (P < 0.02). Anti-MIF mAb significantly reduced IL-1beta-induced COX activity (P < 0.05) and COX-2 mRNA expression. MIF exerts a proinflammatory effect on key aspects of RA FLS activation. That anti-MIF mAb inhibited IL-1beta up-regulation of FLS indicates an additional cofactor role for MIF in IL-1beta-induced FLS activation. These data suggest that MIF antagonism has important therapeutic potential in RA. The interaction of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with its physiological redox partner cytochrome c peroxidase has been investigated using heteronuclear NMR techniques. Chemical shift perturbations for both 15N and 1H nuclei arising from the interaction of isotopically enriched 15N cytochrome c with cytochrome c peroxidase have been observed. For the diamagnetic, ferrous cytochrome c, 34 amides are affected by binding, corresponding to residues at the front face of the protein and in agreement with the interface observed in the 1:1 crystal structure of the complex. In contrast, for the paramagnetic, ferric protein, 56 amides are affected, corresponding to residues both at the front and toward the rear of the protein. In addition, the chemical shift perturbations were larger for the ferric protein. Using experimentally observed pseudocontact shifts the magnetic susceptibility tensor of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c in both the free and bound forms has been calculated with HN nuclei as inputs. In contrast to an earlier study, the results indicate that there is no change in the geometry of the magnetic axes for cytochrome c upon binding to cytochrome c peroxidase. This leads us to conclude that the additional effects observed for the ferric protein arise either from a difference in binding mode or from the more flexible overall structure causing a transmittance effect upon binding. Aberrant regulation of the synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is associated with the pathophysiology of vascular disease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plays a crucial role in regulating the quantity and composition of ECM. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying the expression of the PAI-1 gene remain unclear. We examined the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), either alone or in combination with mitogenic growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), on the PAI-1 expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Cultures of the rabbit vascular smooth muscle cell line C2/2 were used to study the effects of atRA and bFGF separately or together. Treatment of vascular SMCs with atRA in combination with bFGF resulted in an additional increase in PAI-1 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and tissue factor mRNA levels were only minimally affected. The all-trans-RA- and bFGF-mediated increases in PAI-1 mRNA levels were markedly attenuated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by MEK1 or p38MAP kinase inhibitors. The rate of decrease in PAI-1 mRNA levels after actinomycin D treatment was not affected by atRA and bFGF. Transient transfection of the PAI-1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene, which contains 967 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the human PAI-1 gene, revealed that atRA and bFGF additionally increased transcription from this promoter. Progressive 5'-deletion revealed that the promoter region required for such an effect lies between -967 and -260, which contains no canonical sequence for the RA-response element. In agreement with the role of PAI-1 in the inhibition of fibrinolytic activity which stimulates ECM degradation, cell migration was inhibited by treatment with atRA and bFGF. These results indicate that atRA and bFGF can function in a combined fashion and induce PAI-1 synthesis in vascular SMCs, and suggest a role for these two compounds in regulating SMC migration. New tumor formation was suppressed by retinoic acid (RA) administration in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients who have a defect in nuclear excision repair. However, the inhibition is not due to enhanced removal of UV-damaged DNA. These results prompted us to investigate whether or not RA metabolism is abnormal in XP fibroblasts and what the underlying mechanism is. Compared with wild type fibroblasts, low activities of RA synthesis were determined on HPLC in mouse fibroblasts lacking XP group A (XPA) gene and UV-induced XPA deficient cancer cells. Moreover, we observed an impaired expression of cytochrome P450 1a1 in XPA deficient fibroblasts by RT-PCR and a decreased expression of retinoic acid receptor gamma in XPA deficient cancer cells by Western blotting. Finally, pre-treatment of RA isoforms significantly protected the XPA deficient fibroblasts from UV-induced death. These results suggest that decreased structure activity of RA synthesis, resulting from impaired mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 1a1 may, at least together with UV irradiation, involve in skin carcinogenesis in XP patients. Retinoic acid (RA) has already been shown to exert antiapoptotic and antioxidative activity in various cells. In this study, we determined the effect of RA on the mRNA and protein levels of the Cu-,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) during staurosporine-induced apoptosis in primary cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. Exposure to staurosporine (300 nM, 24 h) increased the percentage of apoptotic neurons to 62% compared with 18% in controls. We determined an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content from 4 up to 48 h after the induction of the injury. Treatment with staurosporine did not significantly change the mRNA levels of SOD-1 and SOD-2. However, the SOD-1 and SOD-2 protein levels markedly decreased 24 and 48 h after the addition of staurosporine. Compared with staurosporine-exposed controls, RA (10 nM)-treated cultures showed a significant increase in neuronal survival, a reduced neuronal ROS content, and enhanced protein levels of SOD-1 and SOD-2 24 and 48 h after the start of the exposure to staurosporine. The results suggest that RA reduced staurosporine-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis by preventing the decrease in the protein levels of SOD-1 and SOD-2, and thus supported the antioxidant defense system. Acylation-stimulating protein (ASP), a product of complement C3, stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis in adipocytes. Previous studies have identified transthyretin, associated with chylomicrons, as a stimulator of C3 and ASP production. Since both transthyretin and chylomicrons transport retinyl ester/retinol, our goal was to investigate whether retinoic acid (RA) could be a potential hormonal mediator of the effect. Inhibitors of protein synthesis and protein secretion eliminated the stimulatory effects of chylomicrons on both C3 and ASP production in human differentiated adipocytes, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis and secretion are both required. Incubation with chylomicrons increased C3 mRNA levels (37+/-1.5%). RA alone or with chylomicrons had a stimulatory effect on C3 production (29-fold at 16.6 nM RA) and ASP production. An RA receptor antagonist blocked stimulation of C3 mRNA and C3 secretion by both RA and chylomicrons. Finally, RA and chylomicrons activated a 1.8 kb C3-promoter-luciferase construct transfected into 3T3-F442 and 3T3-L1 cells (by 41+/-0.2% and 69+/-0.3% respectively), possibly via RA receptor half-sites identified by sequence analysis. This is the first evidence documenting stimulation by RA of the C3 gene. Thus we propose RA as a novel cellular trigger in chylomicrons that subsequently results in increased ASP production by adipocytes after a meal. Retinoic acid (RA) slows growth and induces differentiation of tumor cells through activation of RA receptors (RARs). However, melanoma cell lines display highly variable responsiveness to RA, which is a poorly understood phenomenon. By using Northern and Western blot analyses, we show that RA-resistant A375 and RA-responsive S91 melanoma cells express comparable levels of major components of RAR-signaling pathways. However, A375 cells have substantially higher intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than S91 cells. Lowering ROS levels in A375 cells through hypoxic culture conditions restores RAR-dependent trans-activity, which could be further enhanced by addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Hypoxia also enhances RAR activity in the moderately RA-responsive C32 cells, which have intermediate ROS levels. Conversely, increasing oxidative stress in highly RA-responsive S91 and B16 cells, which have low ROS levels, by treatment with H(2)O(2) impairs RAR activity. Consistent with these observations, RA more potently inhibited the proliferation of hypoxic A375 cells than that of normoxic cells. Oxidative states diminish, whereas reducing conditions enhance, DNA binding of retinoid X receptor/RAR heterodimers in vitro, providing a molecular basis for the observed inverse correlation between RAR activity and ROS levels. The redox state of melanoma cells provides a novel, epigenetic control mechanism of RAR activity and RA resistance. To investigate the role of HOXD9 in the proliferation activity of cultured synoviocytes as well as the mechanisms that regulate HOXD9 transcription. Synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) were transfected with HOXD9 complementary DNA to establish stable transformants that overexpressed HOXD9. HOXD9 expression was detected by Western blotting with anti-HOXD9 antibody. The growth properties of the transformants were investigated by proliferation and colony formation assays. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta, c-Fos, and c-Myc was examined by Western blotting. Transcriptional regulation of HOXD9 was examined by transient cotransfection. HOXD9 protein was highly expressed in RA synoviocytes, but there was no expression in OA synoviocytes. HOXD9 transfection induced stable HOXD9 protein expression in synoviocytes and showed an increased proliferation rate under both normal and serum-starved conditions, as well as an enhanced capacity to proliferate anchorage independently to form colonies in soft agar cultures, compared with control transfectants. Higher levels of bFGF and c-Fos were detected in HOXD9 transformants than in controls. Transient cotransfection assays of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and synoviocytes showed that HOXD9 activated the luciferase reporter construct containing the highly conserved region (HCR), an autoregulatory element of HOXD9 promoter. This activation was significantly increased by bFGF, suppressed by TNFalpha, and unchanged by transforming growth factor beta in synoviocytes. Human T lymphotropic virus type I tax also activated the luciferase reporter construct containing the HCR and had a synergistic effect with HOXD9 on HCR promoter activation. Our data suggest that HOXD9 plays a potential role in synovial proliferation. In addition, they suggest that the involvement of HOXD9 in the regulation of cellular growth might be mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of growth-related factors such as bFGF and c-Fos and/or might result from increased transcription activity by its regulators.

Retinoic Acid Attenuates Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS2) Activation in Cultured Rat Cardiac Myocytes and Microvascular Endothelial Cells. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2001) 33, 933-945. The inducible NO synthase (NOS2) in cardiac tissue contributes to myocardial and coronary inflammation and dysfunction. Several natural (endogenous) hormones such as retinoic acid, the active metabolite of vitamin A, have the ability to attenuate NOS2 activation in inflammatory cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RA on NOS2 activation in cultured cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) and adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). CMEC were stimulated either with a combination of 10 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 50 IU/ml interferon- gamma (IFN- gamma) or with a combination of 1 ng/ml interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)+IFN- gamma whereas ARVM were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1 beta and 50 IU/ml IFN- gamma in the absence or presence of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Activation of the NOS2 pathway was estimated by measurement of mRNA (Northern blot) and protein (Western blot) expression, enzyme activity by conversion of [(3)H]L -arginine to [(3)H]L -citrulline, and nitrite accumulation. NOS2 mRNA half-life was studied in CMEC and ARVM in the presence of actinomycin D. In CMEC and ARVM stimulated with a combination of LPS and/or cytokines, atRA (10(-6), 10(-5)M) significantly (P<0.05) attenuated NOS2 mRNA and protein expression, enzymatic activity and reduced supernatant nitrite concentration. Upon stimulation with LPS/IFN- gamma, atRA significantly decreased NOS2 mRNA half-life. This was not seen after stimulation with IL-1 beta/IFN- gamma. These results document for the first time an effect of RA on NOS2 activation in cardiac cells. They may contribute to the characterization of the immunomodulatory effects of retinoids in myocardial and coronary inflammatory disorders. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 produced by NO synthase type 2 (NOS2) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2), respectively, are important mediators in inflammation. There is much information regarding their roles in models of inflammation in mice and in humans with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A variety of stimuli including cytokines, microbial components, immune complexes, and mechanical stress can induce both NOS2 and COX2 mRNA transcription and protein synthesis and enhance inflammation. This has been demonstrated in both mice and humans. NOS2-specific inhibitors reduce inflammation in mice, and COX2-specific inhibitors reduce inflammation in mice and in humans. There is significant cross-talk between PGE2/NO and COX2/NOS2. Treatments that inhibit both NOS2 and COX2 should provide the most potent antiinflammatory effects. Previous experiments in mice and zebrafish led to the hypothesis that an asymmetric distribution of the transcriptional activator retinoic acid (RA) causes ventral-dorsal polarity in the vertebrate eye anlage. A high concentration of RA in the ventral retinal neuroepithelium has been suggested to induce developmental events that finally establish topographic order in the retinotectal projection along the vertical eye axis. In the present study we have investigated potential sources and sinks of RA during embryonic development of the chick retina. At embryonic day (E)1 to E2, when the spatial determination of the eye primordia takes place, no RA synthesis by aldehyde dehydrogenases was detectable, and neither immunoreactivity for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase RALDH-2 nor for cellular retinoic acid binding protein CRABP-I was observed. These components of RA signal transduction appeared in the eye between E3 and E5. At later stages, RA-measurements with a reporter cell line showed highest synthesis in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and at the ventral and dorsal poles of the retina. RA degradation occurred mostly in a horizontal region in the middle of the retina with only small differences along the nasal-temporal axis. CRABP-I immunoreactivity appeared first in differentiating retinal ganglion cells with no indication of a spatial gradient across the ventral-dorsal eye axis. RA-production depended on three NAD+-dependent enzyme activities, which could be competitively inhibited by citral. One enzyme, located in the dorsal retina (corresponding to mouse RALDH-1), and one enzyme in the RPE (RALDH-2) were aldehyde dehydrogenases of the same molecular weight (monomers about 55 kDa) but with different isoelectric points (6.5-6.9; 4.9-5.4). The third RA-synthesizing activity (pI 6.0-6.3) was limited to the ventral retina, and likely corresponded to mouse RALDH-3. The restricted localization of retinoid-metabolizing activities along the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryonic chick retina does support the idea that RA is involved in dorsal-ventral eye patterning. However, the late time of appearance of aldehyde dehydrogenase activities and CRABP-I points to functions in cellular differentiation that are distinct from the initiation of the dorsal-ventral polarity. Interferons (IFNs) and retinoids are potent biological response modifiers. The IFN-beta and all-trans-retinoic acid combination, but not these single agents individually, induces death in several tumor cell lines. To elucidate the molecular basis for these actions, we have employed an antisense knockout approach to identify the gene products that mediate cell death and isolated several genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (GRIMs). One of the GRIM cDNAs, GRIM-12, was identical to human thioredoxin reductase (TR). To define the functional relevance of TR to cell death and to define its mechanism of death-modulating functions, we generated mutants of TR and studied their influence on the IFN/RA-induced death regulatory functions of caspases. Wild-type TR activates cell death that was inhibited in the presence of caspase inhibitors or catalytically inactive caspases. A mutant TR, lacking the active site cysteines, inhibits the cell death induced by caspase 8. IFN/all-trans-retinoic acid-induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondrion was promoted in the presence of wild type and was inhibited in the presence of mutant TR. We find that TR modulates the activity of caspase 8 to promote death. This effect is in part caused by the stimulation of death receptor gene expression. These studies identify a new mechanism of cell death regulation by the IFN/all-trans-retinoic acid combination involving redox enzymes. Retinoids show promise in the treatment of various (pre)malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Previous studies have shown that the metabolic pathways of retinoids are important in the anticancer effect of retinoids, and that these pathways may change during carcinogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed HNSCC cell lines (n = 11) and normal oral keratinocyte cultures (n = 11) by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and conducted growth inhibition assays. We demonstrate here that in contrast to normal oral keratinocytes, HNSCC cell lines: (a) had averaged a 17-fold greater turnover rate of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA); (b) had a 1.9-fold less RA-induced growth inhibition; (c) were able to form polar metabolites; and (d) were able to catabolize 4-oxo-RA. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the RA-specific 4-hydroxylase, CYP26A1, was dramatically increased after RA-induction in the two HNSCC cell lines with the highest metabolism, was undetectable in normal keratinocytes, and was not inducible by RA. Next, introduction of CYP26A1 cDNA in a low-metabolizing HNSCC cell line resulted in an 11-fold higher turnover rate of RA and a 12-fold increase in the amount of polar metabolites, but it did not change sensitivity to RA. These observations point to fundamental changes in RA metabolism pathways during HNSCC carcinogenesis and may provide clues to a more rational approach for RA-mediated intervention. Multiple cytosolic thyroid-hormone-binding proteins (CTBPs) with varying characteristics, depending on the species and tissue, have been reported. We first purified a 59-kDa CTBP from Xenopus liver (xCTBP), and found that it is responsible for major [125I]T(3)-binding activity in Xenopus liver cytosol. Amino acid sequencing of internal peptide fragments derived from xCTBP demonstrated high identity to the corresponding sequence of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 (ALDH1). To confirm whether or not xCTBP is identical to xALDH1, we isolated cDNAs encoding xALDH1 from an adult Xenopus hepatic cDNA library. The amino acid sequences deduced from the two isolated xALDH1 cDNAs were very similar to those of mammalian ALDH1 enzymes. The recombinant xALDH1 protein exhibited both T(3)-binding activity and ALDH activity converting retinal to retinoic acid (RA), which were similar to those of xCTBP purified from liver cytosol. The T(3)-binding activity was inhibited by NAD, while the ALDH activity was inhibited by thyroid hormones. Our results demonstrate that xCTBP is identical to ALDH1 and suggest that this protein might modulate RA synthesis and intracellular concentration of free T(3). Communications between thyroid hormone and retinoid pathways are discussed. The facts that the severity of reflux esophagitis cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of acid exposure and acid suppression treatment is not enough for the complete healing, suggested that other damaging factors might be involved in pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis. The present study was designed to evaluate the oxidative stress as the major pathogenic factor of reflux esophagitis and the importance of antioxidant in treatment of reflux esophagitis. Reflux esophagitis was induced by the insertion of small caliber ring (3 mm in diameter) into the duodenum 1 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz in rats. DA-9601, a novel antioxidant substance, attenuated the gross esophagitis significantly compared to that treated with ranitidine, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2-RA), in a dose-dependent manner. Severe, hemorrhagic, and longitudinal ulcerations were developed in H2-RA pretreated group, whereas mildly scattered erosions were observed in antioxidant-pretreated group. Significantly increased amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA), increased NF-kappaB activation, and the mucosal depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) were observed in the esophagus of reflux esophagitis. H2-RA treatment didn't affect the levels of GSH and MDA, whereas DA-9601 attenuated the decrement of the GSH levels and significantly decreased lipid peroxides in the esophagus. Antioxidants treatment showed significant reductions in the activation of NF-kappaB, inflammation-associated transcription factor, especially p50 component in accordance with significant higher levels of NF-kappaB repressor, IkappaBalpha expression. Oxygen-derived free radicals seem to be one of the important mediators in generation of reflux esophagitis, which suggests that the combination of antioxidant and anti-secretory medications will be ideal and more beneficial in the prevention and treatment of reflux esophagitis than currently prescribed antisecretory treatment alone. Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that retinoids can inhibit the growth of a small percentage of human renal cancers (RCs), although the majority of RCs both in vitro and in vivo are retinoid resistant. Our recent studies indicate that the metabolism of retinol to retinyl esters is greatly reduced in human carcinoma cell lines of the oral cavity, skin, and breast as compared with their normal epithelial counterparts, suggesting that human carcinoma cells are retinoid deficient relative to normal epithelial cells. We considered whether retinoid resistance in RCs was related to an abnormality in retinoid metabolism. The metabolism of [3H]retinol and of [3H]retinoic acid (RA) was examined in RC cell lines and normal human kidney (NK) epithelial cells cultured in media, in RA, or in RA plus IFN-alpha. The expression of LRAT (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase) was assessed by Northern and Western analysis. Retinol and retinyl ester levels were determined in tissue samples of normal human kidney and renal cell carcinoma. NK cells esterified all of the 50 nM [3H]retinol in which they were cultured. In contrast, six of the seven RC cell lines metabolized only trace amounts of [3H]retinol to [3H]retinyl esters. Consistent with this relative lack of [3H]retinol esterification by the tumor cells, the tumor cells exhibited LRAT transcripts of aberrantly low sizes relative to those in normal epithelial cells. Moreover, the NK cells expressed abundant levels of LRAT protein by Western analysis, whereas the RC cells did not express LRAT protein. When samples of human kidney tumor tissue were compared with samples of normal kidney tissue from patients who had undergone surgery for primary RC, the normal kidney tissues contained much higher levels of retinol and retinyl esters (approximately 0.5-2 microg/gram wet weight) than the tumor tissues in all seven patients examined. Culture of the RC lines in IFN-alpha plus all-trans-RA, a combination therapy used clinically, resulted in higher intracellular levels of [3H]retinol and [3H]retinyl esters. The metabolism of [3H]RA was also examined in these RC lines versus NK cells. Although the NK epithelial cells metabolized [3H]RA, the majority of the RC lines metabolized [3H]RA at a much slower rate. Most of the RC lines metabolized only 10-30% of the 50 nM [3H]RA over 6 h of culture. These data indicate that RCs both in vitro and in vivo are retinol and retinyl ester deficient relative to the normal human kidney, and they suggest that the aberrant differentiation of the neoplastic renal cells results in part from a defect in retinoid metabolism. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an important mechanism shaping the size of different cell populations within the developing nervous system. In our study we used the NT2/D1 clone originally established from the Ntera 2 cell line to investigate the baseline levels of apoptosis in cultured postmitotic hNT (NT2-N) neurons previously treated for 3, 4 or 5 weeks with retinoic acid (RA) and compared it with apoptosis in NT2 precursors unexposed to RA. First, we examined whether different lengths of exposure to RA might affect baseline apoptotic rate in differentiating hNT neurons. Second, we investigated whether cultured hNT neurons, previously shown to possess dopaminergic characteristics, would be preferentially affected by apoptosis. Using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (tdt)-labeling technique we found that the postmitotic hNT neuronal cells exposed to RA demonstrated significantly higher numbers of apoptotic cells (12.5-15.8%) in comparison to rapidly dividing NT2 precursor cell line (3.6-4.4%) at both studied (1 and 5 days in vitro, DIV) time points. Similar apoptotic nuclear morphology, including a variable extent of nuclear fragmentation was observed in all examined hNT cultures. On the other hand, the incidence of apoptotic nuclei was rare in cultures of NT2 precursors not subjected to RA treatment. Combined immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Hoechst staining revealed dopaminergic hNT neurons destined to die. Our double-labeling studies have demonstrated that only a subset of TH-positive hNT cells had condensed chromatin after 1 (approx. 15%) and 5 (approx. 20%) DIV. NT2 precursors were not TH-positive. Collectively, our results demonstrated that exposure to differentiating agent RA triggers an apoptotic commitment in a subset of postmitotic hNT neurons. These results suggest that this cell line may serve as a model of neuronal development to test various pathogenic factors implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as to screen numerous pharmacological treatments that may slow or prevent dopaminergic deterioration. Celecoxib is the first COX-2-specific inhibitor approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as for treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. For both OA and RA, celecoxib has been shown to be significantly superior in efficacy to placebo and similar in efficacy to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Its advantage, however, is its gastrointestinal (GI) safety. Randomized clinical trials as well as long-term outcomes studies have demonstrated that the GI safety profile of celecoxib is superior to that of traditional NSAIDs and similar to that of placebo. Additionally, the renal and cardiovascular safety of celecoxib has also become apparent, as well as its efficacy, tolerability and safety in the elderly population. If oxygen-derived free radicals are considered the definitive cause of tonsillar damage after infection, it seems reasonable that scavenger antioxidants levels could be used as a detector of tissue impairment. So, superoxide dismutase (SOD) amounts were measured in palatine tonsils and peripheral blood on subjects bearing of hypertrophy without infection (H, n = 83), recurrent tonsillitis (RA, n = 75), and peritonsillar abscess (PA, n = 12). SOD levels in both tonsillar cultures supernatants and peripheral blood erythrocytes were detected progressively increased in groups with H, RA and PA, which were statistically significative (ANOVA-test; p < 0.001). A significative correlation between tissue and blood was observed for all the groups. We can conclude that SOD concentration in palatine tonsils and/or peripheral blood increases proportionally to infections incidence, which allows detecting patients with functional damage, and recommending objectively tonsillectomy or at least monitoring clinical response for a therapy. Practical use and results obtained from comparison to tonsil biopsies are discussed. To determine the antigens recognized by sera containing classic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCAs) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs). A total of 160 serum samples (all from a reference laboratory) that were originally collected from different clinics for ANCA tests were examined for c-ANCA and p-ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). All positive sera were further tested for reactivity to proteinase 3 (PR3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin (LF), and lysozyme (LZ) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, sera from 110 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 51 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 40 healthy subjects were also tested for reactivity to these antigens. HF detected ANCA in 81 (51%) of the 160 clinical serum samples. Of these 81 serum samples, 21 (26%) contained c-ANCA and 60 (74%) contained p-ANCA. P-ANCA was more commonly found in antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive sera than in ANA-negative sera (p < 0.01). Of the 21 serum samples positive for c-ANCA, 12 (57%) reacted to PR3, four (19%) to LF, four (19%) to LZ, and three (14%) to MPO on ELISA. By contrast, of the 60 sera positive for p-ANCA, 15 (25%) reacted to MPO, 13 (22%) to PR3, eight (13%) to LF, and four (7%) to LZ. The prevalence of ANCA specificities in serum samples from SLE patients were as follows: anti-PR3, 0%; anti-MPO, 1%; anti-LF, 27%; and anti-LZ, 29%. The prevalence of ANCA specificities in serum samples from RA patients were as follows: anti-PR3, 6%; anti-MPO, 2%; anti-LF, 8%; anti-LZ, 4%. Sera positive for c-ANCA and p-ANCA reacted to diverse cytoplasmic antigens from neutrophils. P-ANCA was found in 55% of ANA-positive serum samples. LF and LZ were most commonly found in serum samples from patients with SLE. Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation reduces inflammation in a variety of ocular surface disorders. The aim of this study was to determine if AM stroma suppresses the expression of the IL-1 gene family in cultured human corneal limbal epithelial cells. Human corneal limbal epithelial cells were cultured from limbocorneal explants of donor eyes on plastic or on the AM stroma. Transcript expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and GAPDH was compared with or without addition of lipopolysaccharide to their serum-free media for 24 hours using RNAse protection assay (RPA). Their protein production in the supernatant was analysed by ELISA. Expression of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta transcripts and proteins was significantly reduced by cells cultured on the AM stromal matrix compared with plastic cultures whether lipopolysaccharide was added or not. Moreover, expression of IL-1 RA by cells cultured in the lipopolysaccharide-free medium was upregulated by AM stromal matrix. The ratio between IL-1 RA and IL-1alpha protein levels in AM cultures was higher than in plastic cultures. AM stromal matrix markedly suppresses lipopolysaccharide induced upregulation of both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. These data may explain in part the effect of AM transplantation in reducing ocular surface inflammation, underscoring the unique feature of the AM as a substrate for tissue engineering. RPR132331, a 2-(2-dioxanyl)imidazole, was identified as an inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes. An intensive programme of work exploring the biology, toxicity and physical chemistry of a novel series of inhibitors, derived from RPR132331, has led to the identification of RPR200765A, a development candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RPR200765A is a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (IC50 = 50 nM). It inhibits LPS-stimulated TNFalpha release both in vitro, from human monocytes (EC50 = 110 nM), and in vivo in Balb/c mice (ED50 = 6 mg/kg). At oral doses between 10 and 30 mg/kg/day it reduces the incidence and progression in the rat streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis model when administered in either prophylactic or therapeutic dosing regimens. The compound, which is a mesylate salt and exists as a stable monohydrate, shows good oral bioavailabiltiy (F = 50% in the rat) and excellent chemical stability. The data from the SCW disease model suggests that RPR200765A could exhibit a profile of disease modifying activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients which is not observed with current drug therapies. Several prognostic factors for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been defined in the past. One of these factors appears to be the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. However, the precise predictive value of an elevated LDH level with regard to AML transformation remains uncertain. In this study, the prognostic value of the LDH activity was examined in a cohort of 180 patients with de novo MDS (median age 71 years [27-93]; f/m-ratio 1:1.2; RA: n=53; RARS: n=37; RAEB: n=50; RAEBT: n=19; CMML: n=21). Significant differences in LDH activities were found among FAB groups (P<0.05), and especially among IPSS groups (HIGH: 411+/-574; INT-2: 221+/-90; INT-1: 254+/-145; LOW: 192+/-47 U/l; P<0.05). An LDH level of >/=300 U/l was found to be associated with a significantly shorter median survival (10.3 months) when compared to <300 U/l (33.7 months; P<0.01). Moreover, an LDH activity of >/=300 U/l indicated a reduced AML-free survival in our MDS patients (P<0.01). As assessed by Cox regression, the inclusion of LDH as additional variable into the IPSS system resulted in an improved prediction concerning survival, but not with regard to AML evolution. Together, our data show that a serum LDH activity of >/=300 U/l in MDS is associated with a significantly shorter survival and higher risk to transform to AML. The LDH activity should be considered as an important prognostic factor in MDS. Retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A, has been implicated in various steps of cardiovascular development, but its contribution to early heart morphogenesis has not been clearly established in a mammalian system. To block endogenous RA synthesis, we have disrupted the gene encoding RALDH2, the first retinaldehyde dehydrogenase whose expression has been detected during early mouse post-implantation development. We describe here the heart abnormalities of the RA-deficient Raldh2 mutants that die in utero at gestational day 10.5. The embryonic heart tube forms properly, but fails to undergo rightward looping and, instead, forms a medial distended cavity. Expression of early heart determination factors is not altered in mutants, and the defect in heart looping does not appear to involve the Nodal/Lefty/Pitx2 pathway. Histological and molecular analysis reveal distinct anteroposterior components in the mutant heart tube, although posterior chamber (atria and sinus venosus) development is severely impaired. Instead of forming trabeculae, the developing ventricular myocardium consists of a thick layer of loosely attached cells. Ultrastructural analysis shows that most of the ventricular wall consists of prematurely differentiated cardiomyocytes, whereas undifferentiated cells remain clustered rostrally. We conclude that embryonic RA synthesis is required for realization of heart looping, development of posterior chambers and proper differentiation of ventricular cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, the precise location of this synthesis may not be crucial, as these defects can mostly be rescued by systemic (maternal) RA administration. However, cardiac neural crest cells cannot be properly rescued in Raldh2(-/- )embryos, leading to outflow tract septation defects. Retinoic acid (RA) metabolizing enzymes play important roles in RA signaling during vertebrate embryogenesis. We have previously reported on a RA degrading enzyme, XCYP26, which appears to be critical for the anteroposterior patterning of the central nervous system (EMBO J. 17 (1998) 7361). Here, we report on the sequence, expression and function of its counterpart, XRALDH2, a RA generating enzyme in Xenopus. During gastrulation and neurulation, XRALDH2 and XCYP26 show non-overlapping, complementary expression domains. Upon misexpression, XRALDH2 is found to reduce the forebrain territory and to posteriorize the molecular identity of midbrain and individual hindbrain rhombomeres in Xenopus embryos. Furthermore, ectopic XRALDH2, in combination with its substrate, all-trans-retinal (ATR), can mimic the RA phenotype to result in microcephalic embryos. Taken together, our data support the notion that XRALDH2 plays an important role in RA homeostasis by the creation of a critical RA concentration gradient along the anteroposterior axis of early embryos, which is essential for proper patterning of the central nervous system in Xenopus. We examined the role of the central nervous system, and particularly the renin-angiotensin (RA) system, in the development of hypertension produced by chronic inhibition of NO synthesis. In experiment 1, Wistar rats drank either nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) or tap water. Before L-NAME treatment rats were divided into 6 groups. Four of them were administered either losartan or artificial cerebroventricular fluid (a-CSF) intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) for 1 week using an osmotic mini pump. The other two groups were administered the same amount of losartan intravenously (i.v.). In experiment 2, cardiovascular responses to acute i.c.v. losartan and muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist, were examined in conscious L-NAME-treated rats. Finally, in experiment 3, effects of ablation of the AV3V (anteroventral third ventricle) area, known to be one of the centers of cardiovascular control, were tested in the development of L-NAME hypertension. The development of hypertension by L-NAME treatment was attenuated with chronic i.c.v. losartan in a dose-dependent manner, while i.v. losartan had no effect. One week after cessation of i.c.v. losartan, blood pressure was elevated to the same level as in a-CSF-infused, L-NAME-treated rats. Acute i.c.v. losartan produced no cardiovascular changes in either L-NAME-treated or control rats. On the other hand, although i.c.v. muscimol elicited depressor effects in both groups, these responses were significantly larger in L-NAME-treated rats. Cardiovascular responses to i.v. hexamethonium were similar in both groups. The existence of prior lesions in the AV3V area significantly attenuated the development of L-NAME-induced hypertension. These results indicate that the central RA system plays an important role in the development of hypertension produced by chronic inhibition of NO synthase. Moreover, disorder of the central GABA system, rather than that of the RA system, might be important in the maintenance of hypertension in this model. To clarify the clinical significance of autoantibodies (auto-Ab) to interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with interstitial lung disease (ILD), we examined the IL-1alpha auto-Ab level in serum of patients with RA with/without ILD. We investigated the level of IL-1alpha auto-Ab in serum of 70 patients with RA with/without ILD and 40 control patients (CP). Levels of IL-1alpha auto-Ab were measured by radioimmunoassay, and serum was regarded as IL-1alpha auto-Ab positive at an auto-Ab level of more than 5 ng/mL. Interleukin-1alpha auto-Ab was detected in the serum of 30 out of 70 RA patients (42.9%), and six out of 40 CP (15%) (P < 0.05). Interleukin-1alpha auto-Ab were detected in the serum of 18 out of 32 patients with RA with ILD (56.2%) and 12 out of 38 patients with RA without ILD (31.5%). The positive rate of these autoantibodies in RA with ILD was significantly higher than that in RA without ILD (P < 0.05). Although C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin G, rheumatoid factor and rheumatoid arthritis particle agglutination levels in serum from patients with RA with ILD were not significantly different between the IL-1alpha auto-Ab-positive and -negative groups, the lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH) and AaDO, in the IL-1alpha auto-Ab-positive group were significantly higher than those in the negative group (LDH: P < 0.001, AaDO2: P < 0.05). These results suggest that IL-1alpha auto-Ab are generated in response to the immunoinflammatory process of ILD in RA, and these autoantibodies may neutralize and regulate the IL-1alpha activity. Long-term and excessive ethanol intake results in decreased plasma and hepatic levels of retinoic acid (RA), the most active derivative of vitamin A. The decrease of RA by ethanol treatment has been proposed to be a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)-dependent process. However, the role of the major ethanol-induced CYP, CYP2E1, in the metabolism of RA has not been defined. In vitro incubations of RA with microsomal fractions of liver tissue containing CYPs from either ethanol-exposed or non-ethanol-exposed rats were carried out using chemical inhibitors and antibodies against various CYPs. In vivo, both ethanol-exposed and non-ethanol-exposed rats were treated with or without chlormethiazole, a specific CYP2E1 inhibitor, for 1 month. RA and its catabolic metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis. Incubation of RA with the liver microsomal fraction from ethanol-exposed rats resulted in greater disappearance of RA and increased appearance of 18-hydroxy-RA and 4-oxo-RA compared with control rat liver microsomal fractions. The enhancement of RA catabolism by ethanol was inhibited by both CYP2E1 antibody and specific inhibitors (allyl sulfide and chlormethiazole) in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the metabolism of RA into polar metabolites was abolished completely by nonspecific CYP inhibitors (disulfiram and liarozole). Furthermore, treatment with chlormethiazole in ethanol-fed rats in vivo restored both hepatic and plasma RA concentrations to normal levels. Ethanol-induced CYP2E1 plays a major role in the degradation of RA, which may provide a possible biochemical mechanism for chronic and excessive ethanol intake as a risk for both hepatic and extrahepatic cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. In order to assess a possible role of the natural glutathione defense system in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), serum reduced glutathione levels (GSH), glutathione reductase (GSR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, lipid peroxidation (MDA content) and indexes of inflammation were evaluated in 58 rheumatic patients. Rheumatoid athritis was associated with significant depletion (ca. 50%) in GSH levels compared with normal control subjects. Serum levels of the detoxifying enzymes GSR and GSH-Px decreased by ca. 50% and 45%, respectively, whereas a threefold increase in the activity of GST was observed. A 1.2-fold increase in ALP was observed in patients with RA. These effects were accompanied by a 3.1-fold increase in serum MDA content. The MDA content was higher in RA patients who were seropositive for rheumatoid factor as well as positive for C-reactive proteins. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate for all patients with RA was approximately 13.8-fold higher than for the control group, and was higher among RA patients who were positive for C-reactive proteins and exhibited seropositivity for rheumatoid factor. Patients with RA receiving gold therapy exhibited significantly lower MDA levels whereas all other factors that were measured were not effected. The results support a hypothesis that defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species are impaired in RA. The biological effects of vitamin A are mediated in part by retinoic acid (RA) modulation of gene transcription. In this study, we examined whether normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) are biologically responsive to retinol (ROH), the metabolic precursor of RA. While both ROH and tRA resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in total cell number, tRA was markedly more potent. Metabolically, treatment of HMECs with physiological doses of ROH resulted in rapid uptake and subsequent production of both retinyl esters and tRA. Although a comparatively minor metabolite, tRA levels peaked at 6 h and remained above endogenous levels for up to 72 h in proportion to cellular ROH concentrations. In HMECs transfected with an RA-responsive luciferase reporter gene, treatment with 3 microM ROH resulted in an increase in luciferase activity to a level intermediate between that observed with 0.001 and 0.01 microM tRA. Citral, an RA-synthesis inhibitor, was also used to examine the biological activity of ROH. Compared to ROH alone, ROH plus citral treatment resulted in three-fold less tRA synthesis and a > 65% attentuation of RA-responsive reporter gene activity which persisted through 72 h. Citral also significantly attenuated the extent of ROH-mediated reductions in total HMEC number. Thus, treatment with physiological concentrations of ROH results in fewer total numbers of HMECs and this response is a consequence of cellular tRA synthesis which can induce RA-responsive gene expression. We examined expression of retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) types 1 and 2 in liver and lung, and the effect of vitamin A status on testis expression by in situ hybridization. Liver expressed RALDH1 and RALDH2 only in stellate cells and hepatocytes, respectively. Lung expressed RALDH1 and RALDH2 throughout the epithelia of the airways, from the principal bronchi to the respiratory bronchiole. Vitamin A-sufficient rats expressed RALDH1 in spermatocytes, with less intense expression in spermatogonia and spermatids, and expressed RALDH2 in interstitial cells, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes. Neither Sertoli nor peritubular cells showed detectable RALDH1 or RALDH2 mRNA. Vitamin A deficiency produced a sevenfold increase in RALDH1 and a 70-fold decrease in RALDH2 mRNA in testis. In each case, the net change reflected extensive loss of germ cells, increased intensity of expression in residual germ cells, and expression in Sertoli and peritubular cells. Low-dose RA relatively early during vitamin A depletion supported spermatogenesis and affected expression of both RALDHs, but did not reinstate "vitamin A normal" expression patterns. These results show that: RALDH1 and RALDH2 have distinct mRNA expression patterns in multiple cell types in three vitamin A target tissues; RALDH expression occurs in cell types that express cellular retinol-binding protein and retinol dehydrogenase isozymes (except stellate cells, for which retinol dehydrogenase expression remains unknown); vitamin A deficiency and RA supplementation affects the loci and intensity of RALDH mRNAs in testis; and low-dose RA does not substitute completely for retinol. Overall, these data provide insight into the unique functions of RALDH1 and RALDH2 in retinoid metabolism. Retinoic acid (RA) induces growth-arrest of many tumor cell lines but it is an ineffective therapeutic against melanoma. We investigated whether the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-inhibitor sodium butyrate (BUT) can restore or potentiate the RA-response of RA-resistant human A375, and RA-responsive S91 murine melanoma cells. BUT induced expression of RARbeta and p21(waf1/cip1) mRNA in A375 cells but in S91 cells only p21(waf1/cip1) was induced. RA and BUT synergistically activated transcription of an RA-dependent reporter gene in S91, but not A375 cells. BUT increased histone H4-acetylation in both cell types. RA potentiated BUT-mediated inhibition of S91 cell proliferation, whereas A375 cells remained largely resistant to both compounds. HDAC-inhibitors may enhance the activity of RA on RA-responsive melanoma cells. Previous work has shown that neuroblastoma cells secrete IGFBP-2, -4 and -6 and that expression of these proteins is regulated by retinoic acid (at-RA) which promotes differentiation in these cells. Other agents also induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cells: these include the 9- cis and 13- cis isomers of at-RA, 1,25 dihydroxy- vitamin D3 (VD3), triidothyronine (T3) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Nine- cis and 13- cis isomers of at-RA increased IGFBP-6 expression, but decreased IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4. VD3 stimulated IGFBP-6 and IGFBP-2 expression, whereas T3 inhibited IGFBP-6 expression without affecting IGFBP-2. TPA markedly enhanced expression of all three IGFBPs produced by SK-N-SH cells. Since IGFBP-6 secretion is associated with the arrest of proliferation in neuroblastoma cells and is regulated by the combined actions of differentiation factors, we subcloned the proximal promoter of human IGFBP-6 (nt -766/+1) into a pCAT expression vector so as to examine modulation of its transcriptional activity. VD3 and TPA were capable of stimulating promoter activity, T3 depressed it and at-RA and its 9- cis and 13- cis isomers had no effect. These results confirm the high sensitivity of IGFBP-6 expression to these differentiation agents, essentially at transcriptional level. The active derivative of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), is essential for normal embryonic development. The spatio-temporal distribution of embryonic RA results from regulated expression of RA-synthesizing retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and RA-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (CYP26). Excess RA administration or RA deficiency results in a complex spectrum of embryonic abnormalities. As a first step in understanding the developmental function of RA-metabolizing enzymes, we have disrupted the murine Cyp26A1 gene. We report that Cyp26A1-null mutants die during mid-late gestation and show a number of major morphogenetic defects. Spina bifida and truncation of the tail and lumbosacral region (including abnormalities of the kidneys, urogenital tract, and hindgut) are the most conspicuous defects, leading in extreme cases to a sirenomelia ("mermaid tail") phenotype. Cyp26A1 mutants also show posterior transformations of cervical vertebrae and abnormal patterning of the rostral hindbrain, which appears to be partially posteriorly transformed. These defects correlate with two major sites of Cyp26A1 expression in the rostral neural plate and embryonic tail bud. Because all of the Cyp26A1(-/-) abnormalities closely resemble RA teratogenic effects, we postulate that the key function of CYP26A1 is to maintain specific embryonic areas in a RA-depleted state, to protect them against the deleterious effect of ectopic RA signaling. Retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, plays a pivotal role in vertebrate development. The level of RA may be determined by the balance between its synthesis and degradation. We have examined the role of CYP26, a P450 enzyme that may degrade RA, by generating mutant mice that lack CYP26. CYP26(-/-) mice exhibited anomalies, including caudal agenesis, similar to those induced by administration of excess RA. The concentration of endogenous RA, as revealed by marker gene activity, was markedly increased in the tailbud of the mutant animals, in which CYP26 is normally expressed. Expression of T (Brachyury) and Wnt3a in the tailbud was down-regulated in CYP26(-/-) mice, which may underlie the caudal truncation. The lack of CYP26 also resulted in homeotic transformation of vertebrae as well as in misspecification of the rostral hindbrain associated with anterior expansion of RA-positive domains. These results suggest that local degradation of RA by CYP26 is required for establishing an uneven distribution of RA along the anterio-posterior axis, which is essential for patterning the hindbrain, vertebrae, and tailbud. Retinal dehydrogenase type 1 (RALDH1) is involved in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA), a modulator of gene expression and cell differentiation. RALDH1 mRNA transcripts are present in the stomach and small intestine, and their expression is regulated by vitamin A status. In situ hybridization demonstrated RALDH1 mRNA expression in epithelial cells of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Strong hybridization was also seen in the lamina propria of small intestinal mucosa and the smooth muscle layer of the small and large intestines. Immunocytochemical localization revealed RALDH1 staining in parietal cells of the stomach and prismatic cells of the small and large intestines. The presence of RALDH1 protein was also detectable within supportive glial cells around neuronal fibers throughout the muscular layers of the stomach as well as the small and large intestines. These data suggest an important role for RALDH1 in generating RA needed for the differentiation of specific epithelial cells in the stomach and intestines. The Halobacterium salinarum catalase-peroxidase gene was subcloned into shuttle vectors pWL102 and pWL202 and expressed under the control of different archaeal promoters. When Hbt. salinarum was transformed with the catalase-peroxidase gene under the control of its own promoter, catalase-peroxidase activity increased twofold. Catalase-peroxidase activity increased threefold when Hbt. salinarum was transformed with the catalase-peroxidase gene under the control of a tRNA promoter. This bifunctional enzyme in Hbt. salinarum was not induced by environmental stresses such as H2O2, intense light, darkness, high temperature, low temperature, redox inhibitors, heavy metals, or ions. Retinoic acid-mediated gene activation is important for normal vertebrate development. The size and nature of retinoic acid make it difficult to identify the precise cellular location of this signaling molecule throughout an embryo. Additionally, retinoic acid (RA) signaling is regulated by a complex combination of receptors, coactivators, and antagonizing proteins. Thus, in order to integrate these signals and identify regions within a whole developing embryo where cells can respond transcriptionally to retinoic acid, we have used a reporter transgenic approach. We have generated several stable lines of transgenic zebrafish which use retinoic acid response elements to drive fluorescent protein expression. In these zebrafish lines, transgene expression is localized to regions of the neural tube, retina, notochord, somites, heart, pronephric ducts, branchial arches, and jaw muscles in embryos and larvae. Transgene expression can be induced in additional regions of the neural tube and retina as well as the immature notochord, hatching gland, enveloping cell layer, and fin by exposing embryos to retinoic acid. Treatment with retinoic acid synthase inhibitors, citral and diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), during neurulation, greatly reduces transgene expression. DEAB treatment of embryos at gastrulation phenocopies the embryonic effects of vitamin A deprivation or targeted disruption of the RA synthase retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 in other vertebrates. Together these data suggest that the reporter expression we see in zebrafish is dependent upon conserved vertebrate pathways of RA synthesis. Forty adult patients (30 women and 10 men) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were studied. Serum levels of immunoreactive ceruloplasmin, oxidase activity of the ceruloplasmin and total copper, as well as the specific oxidase activity (enzyme activity per unit of mass) and the copper/immunoreactive ceruloplasmin relationship were significantly higher in the group of patients than in the healthy control group (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was found for the concentration of non-ceruloplasmin copper between both groups. A statistically significant negative correlation was obtained for the concentration of serum thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances with the immunoreactive ceruloplasmin and its oxidase activity in the group of patients (p < 0.005). These results suggest that in RA increases of serum copper are produced at the expense of the fraction linked to the ceruloplasmin, diminishing the proportion of apoceruloplasmin and other forms poor in copper. Although the increase in the serum concentration of ceruloplasmin might offer an additional safeguard against oxidative stress. it does not appear to have a beneficial effect upon the activity of the illness as evaluated by means the biological inflammation markers C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and sialic acid. Cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is important for the expression of its biological activity. Because the human P450s involved in the formation of the principal atRA metabolites have been only partially identified, the purpose of this study was to identify the human P450s involved in atRA metabolism. The use of phenotyped human liver microsomes (n = 16) allowed the identification of the following P450s: 2B6, 2C8, 3A4/5, and 2A6 were involved in the formation of 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA; 2B6, 2C8, and 2A6 correlated with the formation of 18-OH-RA; and 2A6, 2B6, and 3A4/5 activities correlated with 5, 6-epoxy-RA formation (30-min incubation, 10 microM atRA, HPLC separation, UV detection 340 nm). The use of 15 cDNA-expressed human P450s from lymphoblast microsomes, showed the formation of 4-OH-RA by CYP3A7 > CYP3A5 > CYP2C18 > CYP2C8 > CYP3A4 > CYP2C9, whereas the 18-OH-RA formation involved CYPs 4A11 > 3A7 > 1A1 > 2C9 > 2C8 > 3A5 > 3A4 >2C18. Kinetic studies identified 3A7 as the most active P450 in the formation of three of the metabolites: for 4-OH-retinoic acid, 3A7 showed a V(max)/K(m) of 127.7, followed by 3A5 (V(max)/K(m) = 25.6), 2C8 (V(max)/K(m) = 24.5), 2C18 (V(max)/K(m) = 15.8), 3A4 (V(max)/K(m) = 5.7), 1A1 (V(max)/K(m) = 5.0), and 4A11 (V(max)/K(m) = 1.9); for 4-oxo-RA, 3A7 showed a V(max)/K(m) of 13.4, followed by a 10-fold lower activity for both 2C18 and 4A11 (V(max)/K(m) = 1.2); and for 18-OH-RA, 3A7 showed a V(max)/K(m) of 10.5 compared with a V(max)/K(m) of 2.1 for 4A11 and 2.0 for 2C8. 5,6-Epoxy-RA was only detected at high substrate concentrations in this system (>10 microM), and P450s 2C8, 2C9, and 1A1 were the most active in its formation. The use of embryonic kidney cells (293) stably transfected with human P450 cDNA confirmed the major involvement of P450s 3A7, 1A1, and 2C8 in the oxidation of atRA, and to a lesser extent, 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4. In conclusion, several human P450s involved in atRA metabolism have been identified, the expression of which was shown to direct atRA metabolism toward the formation of specific metabolites. The role of these human P450s in the biological and anticancer effects of atRA remains to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated that the constitutive expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) biosynthesis were significantly enhanced in human skin epidermal cancer cells and that cancer cell growth was effectively inhibited by the suppression of COX-2 expression by transfection with COX-2 antisense oligonucleotide. The purpose of this study was to search for agents which suppress COX-2 expression and examine their effects on cell growth. Since retinoids and antioxidants have been used for chemoprevention of cancers in several tissues, the effects of these agents on COX-2 expression and PGE(2) biosynthesis in skin squamous carcinoma cells were investigated. Treatment with a retinoid (9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA)) or an antioxidant (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC)) suppressed COX-2 expression and PGE(2) biosynthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell growth was significantly inhibited by 9-cis-RA and PDTC. These results suggest that 9-cis-RA and PDTC may be useful in preventing skin cancer growth and that COX-2 is involved in their protective effects on skin carcinogenesis. Retinol and its metabolites (retinoids) are essential for growth and cell differentiation, particularly of epithelial tissue. Retinoids mediate most of their function via interaction with retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors), which act as ligand-activated transcription factors controlling the expression of a number of target genes. We have investigated whether retinoid receptor ligands such as all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) are formed in the human intestinal epithelium from dietary vitamin A. We show here that retinol was metabolized to its active metabolite, all-trans-RA, by isolated cytosolic fractions of human small intestinal enterocytes and by human Caco-2 cells. All-trans-RA was metabolized by human small intestinal microsomes to at least two metabolites (all-trans-4-hydroxy-RA and all-trans-4-oxo-RA). When Caco-2 cells were incubated with all-trans-RA, at least three major polar metabolites (all-trans-4-hydroxy-RA, all-trans-4-oxo-RA, and 13-cis-4-hydroxy-RA) were identified by HPLC-UV. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone inhibited the metabolism of all-trans-RA, whereas the CYP1A1 inducer beta-naphthoflavone induced the metabolism of all-trans-RA, suggesting that CYP1A1 is involved. The induction of CYP3A by rifampicin enhanced the metabolism, and the induction of all-trans-RA metabolism was also observed after preincubation of the cells with all-trans-RA. Liarozole almost completely inhibited the RA metabolism. The specific retinoic acid metabolizing CYP26 was induced after RA treatment in Caco-2 cells. It is concluded that in addition to CYP1A1 and CYP3A, CYP26 may be the main CYP enzyme responsible for the metabolism of all-trans-RA in enterocytes. Active ligands such as all-trans-RA are formed in intestinal epithelial cells. After traumatic injury to the central nervous system (CNS), various cytokines orchestrate the physiological responses of injured neurons and glial cells. The control of these intercellular signals is of major interest from a medical point of view. Since the transcriptional activator retinoic acid (RA) is known to regulate gene expression of cytokines in various cell culture systems we investigated the role of RA signaling in glial cells. The transcriptional activity of RA-induced genes is largely determined by the distribution of RA, which in turn depends on the local oxidation of retinaldehyde (RAL). This is synthesized from retinol or internalized as a component of vitamin A. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography and an RA-sensitive reporter cell line, we showed that OLN-93 cells, which serve as a model system for CNS oligodendrocytes, convert all-trans-RAL to the biologically active form all-trans-RA, but neither oxidize 9-cis-RAL nor isomerize RA enzymatically. The oligodendrocyte cell line expresses a cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase with an apparent molecular weight of 54-57 kDa and pI of 5.3-5.7. As indicated by a zymography bioassay, this enzyme is responsible for RA synthesis. The reaction requires NAD+ as cosubstrate and can be inhibited by disulfiram and citral. No other RA-producing enzyme activities were detected. These findings are in accordance with a putative role for retinoid signaling in neuroglial interactions in the CNS. To evaluate the polygenic regulated caffeine metabolism in a group of 226 patients with liver alcoholic cirrhosis classified according to the Child score. Over a 14-year period an hepatic function test, using caffeine as probe drug, has been systematically associated to the usual clinical and biochemical investigations performed in patients with liver alcoholic cirrhosis. "Caffeine test" consisted in a 200 mg caffeine oral intake. Urines were collected over 24 hours: caffeine (137X), 1-7 dimethylxanthine (17X), 1-3 dimethylxanthine (13X), 1-3 dimethylurate (13U), 3-7 dimethylxanthine (37X), 1-7 dimethylurate (17U), 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1-methylurate (1U), 7-methylxanthine (7X), 3-methylxanthine (3X), and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracyl (AFMU) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total and individual metabolite urinary elimination rates were expressed in micromol/24 hours. Enzyme activities were evaluated from the following urinary metabolites ratios: (AFMU+1U+1X)/17U for CYPIA2, 17U/17X for CYP2A6, AFMU/(AFMU+ 1U+1X) for NAT-2, 1U/1X for XO. Compared to healthy subjects, whatever the Child score, caffeine metabolism was reduced by half in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The main cause was the decreased CYP1A2 activity. On the other hand, XO and CYP2A6 activities were increased and NAT-2 activity remained unchanged in slow acetylators (SA) and decreased in rapid acetylators (RA) Child B and C. Bimodality of NAT-2 distribution was unclear, but a right assignment of RA and SA phenotype in cirrhotic patients, confirmed by comparison with genotype, was obtained, using the antimode value of NAT-2 distribution used in healthy subjects. At last, there was an interindividual variability in caffeine metabolism as great as in the usual laboratory parameters. Metabolism of caffeine is decreased in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. This decrease paralleled the modifications of the usual laboratory tests and does not bring additional information on the severity of the disease. But the equilibrium between the various metabolic pathways of caffeine is impaired. Beyond the changes of a specific enzymatic activity, this must be taken into account particularly for drugs whose metabolism is of the polygenic regulation type. The bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 are known to be important in bone formation and are expressed in both the developing and adult mammalian bone. Understanding the regulation of these genes in osteoblasts may yield methods by which we can control expression to induce bone formation. We have isolated and characterized the human BMP-2 and BMP-4 promoters and report substantially more upstream sequence information than that which has been published. Human osteoblasts were found to have a single transcript initiation site that is conserved across species, rather than multiple start sites, as has previously been reported (Feng, J.Q., Harris, M.A., Ghosh-Choudhury, N., Feng, M., Mundy, G.R., Harris, S.E., 1994. Structure and sequence of mouse morphogenetic protein-2 gene (BMP-2): comparison of the structures and promoter regions of BMP-2 and BMP-4 genes. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1218, 221-224; Heller, L.C., Li, Y., Abrams, K.L., Rogers, M.B., 1999. Transcriptional regulation of the Bmp2 gene. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1394-1400; Sugiura, T., 1999. Cloning and functional characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the human bone morphogenetic protein-2 gene. Biochem. J. 338, 433-440). A series of promoter deletions for both human BMP-2 and BMP-4 fused to the luciferase reporter gene were analyzed thoroughly in human and murine osteoblastic cell lines. Several compounds and growth factors that stimulate general or osteogenic pathways were used to treat cells transfected with the promoter constructs. Retinoic acid compounds and the phorbol ester, PMA were found to stimulate BMP-2 and, to a lesser degree, BMP-4. The combination of all trans-RA and PMA caused a synergistic increase in BMP-2 promoter activity and endogenous mRNA. The RA stimulation appears to be an indirect effect on the BMP-2 promoter, as the most highly conserved RRE in the BMP-2 promoter was unable to functionally bind or compete for protein binding. Potential binding sites in both promoters for the bone-specific transcription factor, Cbfa-1, were found to specifically bind Cbfa-1 protein in osteoblast nuclear extracts; however, deletion of these sites did not significantly affect transcriptional activity of the promoters in osteoblasts. These data thus present new sequence and regulatory information for the human BMP-2 and BMP-4 promoters and clarify the human BMP-2 gene transcriptional start site in osteoblasts. Vitamin A and its metabolite retinoic acid modulate the host response to pathogens through poorly characterized mechanisms. In vitro studies have suggested that retinoic acid decreases inducible NO synthase (NOS2, or iNOS) expression, a component of innate immunity, in several cell types stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokines. This study investigated the effect of retinoic acid on LPS-stimulated NOS2 expression in vivo. Wistar-Kyoto rats received all-trans retinoic acid (RA, 10 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally daily for 5 days followed by LPS (4 mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneally and were killed 6 h later. NOS2 activation was estimated by mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western-blot) expression and plasma nitrate/nitrite accumulation. In sharp contrast to previous in vitro study reports, RA significantly enhanced NOS2 mRNA, protein expression, and plasma nitrate/nitrite concentration in LPS-injected rats but not in saline-injected rats. This was associated with increased expression of interleukin-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN regulatory factor-1 mRNAs in several organs and increased IFN-gamma plasma concentration. RA significantly increased mortality in LPS-injected rats. The NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg before LPS injection) significantly attenuated the RA-mediated increase in mortality. These results demonstrate for the first time that RA supplementation in vivo enhances activation of the LPS-triggered NOS2 pathway. We have previously reported that expression of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene in mouse embryonal cells was not induced by hypoxia, although hypoxia induced other hypoxia-inducible genes. This study identifies retinoic acid (RA) as an inducer for Epo production in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines P19 and F9. RA induced Epo production through the transcriptional activation of the Epo gene in an oxygen-independent manner. With the use of reporter assays in P19 cells, it is shown that a direct repeat of the nuclear hormone receptor-binding motif separated by a 2-bp spacer (DR-2) in the hypoxia-response enhancer was responsible for the transcriptional activation by RA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that nuclear extracts from P19 cells contained RA receptor complexes that bound to DR-2. In human hepatoma Hep3B cells, an orphan receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4, strongly augmented hypoxic induction of the Epo gene in cooperation with hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) by binding to DR-2, whereas in P19 cells, the interaction of RA receptors with DR-2 was sufficient for RA-induced transcriptional activation of the Epo gene without the requirement of the HIF-1 site. These results suggest that DR-2 regulates expression of the Epo gene by acting as the binding site for different transcription factors in different types of cells. In the developing retina, a retinoic acid (RA) gradient along the dorso-ventral axis is believed to be a prerequisite for the establishment of dorso-ventral asymmetry. This RA gradient is thought to result from the asymmetrical distribution of RA-generating aldehyde dehydrogenases along the dorso-ventral axis. Here, we identified a novel aldehyde dehydrogenase specifically expressed in the chick ventral retina, using restriction landmark cDNA scanning (RLCS). Since this molecule showed enzymatic activity to produce RA from retinaldehyde, we designated it retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (RALDH-3). Structural similarity suggested that RALDH-3 is the orthologue of human aldehyde dehydrogenase 6. We also isolated RALDH-1 which is expressed in the chick dorsal retina and implicated in RA formation. Raldh-3 was preferentially expressed first in the surface ectoderm overlying the ventral portion of the prospective eye region and then in the ventral retina, earlier than Raldh-1 in chick and mouse embryos. High level expression of Raldh-3 was also observed in the nasal region. In addition, we found that Pax6 mutants are devoid of Raldh-3 expression. These results suggested that Raldh-3 is the key enzyme in the formation of an RA gradient along the dorso-ventral axis during the early eye development, and also in the development of the olfactory system. Research strongly indicates that increased expression of the isoenzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is responsible for elevated production of prostaglandins in inflamed joint tissues and is involved in the mediation of pain. In contrast, COX-1 is a constitutively produced isoenzyme that is involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids that have important homeostatic functions, for example, in the gastric mucosa and platelets. This new knowledge led to the development of drugs that are highly specific inhibitors of COX-2 while not inhibiting COX-1 at maximally efficacious dosages. The first COX-2 specific agent approved for clinical use in the United States was celecoxib. Large multicenter trials have shown that celecoxib at dosages of 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID is as effective as naproxen 500 mg BID in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. Another large multicenter trial also demonstrated that celecoxib 200 mg BTD and 400 mg BID is as effective as naproxen 500 mg BID in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A comparative trial showed that celecoxib 200 mg BID is as effective as diclofenac SR 75 mg BID in patients with RA. The potential of COX-2 specific inhibitors to provide antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy equivalent to that of conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs without the adverse gastrointestinal mucosal and platelet effects associated with nonspecific COX inhibitors promises to revolutionize the clinical care of arthritis patients. Arachidonic acid metabolism is governed by 2 isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inducible COX-2. Antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are explained by the capacity of these agents to inhibit COX-2, whereas the serious gastrointestinal side effects are caused by inhibitors of COX-1. The first of a new class of COX inhibitors, the COX-2 specific inhibitors, has just been approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As the clinical outcomes of specific COX-2 inhibitors are considerably different than those of NSAID, it is essential for the clinician to understand the basis of classification of those new, effective, and safer therapeutic agents for the treatment of OA and RA. The bioactivity of retinol (vitamin A) is in part dependent on its metabolism to retinoic acid (RA). We investigated the ability of breast epithelial cells to synthesize RA when challenged with a physiological retinol dose (2 microM). Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) cultured from reduction mammoplasties were competent in RA synthesis and the ability to synthesize RA was retained by immortal, nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines (MTSV1.7, MCF-10F, and 184B5). In contrast, most (five of six) breast cancer cell lines could not synthesize RA or did so at low rates relative to normal cells. A notable exception was the MDA-MB-468 cell line, which was fully competent in RA synthesis. Most (>/=68%) of the RA synthesized by breast cells was recovered from the culture medium. Cellular retinol binding protein and cellular RA binding protein II, both expressed in HMEC, had various expression patterns in the cell lines that did not correlate with the observed differences in RA synthesizing ability. Strong RA induction of the RA hydroxylase P450RAI (CYP26) was confined to ERalpha-positive T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells and did not appear to explain the lack of detectable RA levels in these cells since RA remained undetectable when the cells were treated with 5-10 microM liarozole, a P450RAI inhibitor. We hypothesize that retinol bioactivity is impaired in breast cancer cells that cannot synthesize RA. In preliminary support of this hypothesis, we found that retinol (0.5-2 microM) inhibited MCF-10F but not T47D or MCF-7 cell growth. The property of forming crosslinks within DNA is seen as the major cause of the high carcinogenic, genotoxic and anti-neoplastic potency of bifunctional nitrogen mustards. To further investigate the importance for genotoxicity of a second reactive group in a molecule, the genetic activity profiles of the bifunctional nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine (MEC) and its monofunctional counterpart 2-chloroethylamine (CEA) were compared, using several in vivo end points in Drosophila. When post-meiotic male germ cells were alkylated by CEA and then transferred to nucleotide excision repair (NER)-proficient oocytes, no more than up to 4-fold increased forward mutation frequencies were induced. With oocytes deficient for XPG (DmXPG), frequencies were enhanced up to 50 times. For MEC mutation frequencies increased up to 40 times the background, whereas only a low hypermutability was observed when DmXPG were used instead of wild-type females, indicating that nitrogen mustard-induced monoadducts, in contrast to crosslinks, are efficiently repaired by the NER system. Specific locus mutations generated in the vermilion gene by CEA under NER(-) conditions were almost exclusively base pair substitutions (93%). The high proportion of mutations at guanine positions indicates a strong contribution of N7-alkylguanine to the mutational spectrum. MEC induced 64% deletions and other DNA rearrangements in crosses of males with DmXPG females. The small portion of point mutations (36%) was further reduced to approximately 20% with NER(+) females. Inactivation of NER had no potentiating effect on clastogenic events (chromosome loss) induced by CEA, which is in sharp contrast to the strongly enhanced forward mutation frequencies measured with DmXPG females. The weak genotoxic effectiveness of CEA under NER(+) conditions is clearly due to efficient error-free repair of monoalkyl adducts. These results further support the concept that bifunctional nitrogen mustards exert their mutagenic activity through formation of DNA crosslinks and that DNA monoadducts make only a minor contribution to their genotoxic activity. The study of drug metabolism in cultured rat hepatocytes is hampered by the rapid loss of the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Nevertheless, the activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), one of the most important isoenzymes for drug metabolism, can be elevated by chemical inducers. In the present study, we investigated in cultured rat hepatocytes the induction of all four currently identified CYP3A isoforms by dexamethasone, and compared the results obtained in vitro with the induction profile of dexamethasone in vivo. To this end, CYP3A mRNA levels were quantified with a novel, radioactive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and CYP3A enzymatic activity was measured by a testosterone hydroxylation assay. In the RT-PCR assay, CYP3A isoforms were co-amplified with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the presence of radioactively labeled nucleotides. This resulted in an extremely sensitive and accurate determination of CYP3A expression levels, relative to those of GAPDH. Using this RT-PCR assay, it was found that the expression of all CYP3A isoforms in rat hepatocytes, cultured on a collagen matrix, was decreased by 80-90% within one day of cultivation. After addition of dexamethasone, at one day after isolation, CYP3A1 mRNA levels were elevated to levels comparable to those in freshly isolated hepatocytes within two days. In contrast, CYP3A2, CYP3A9, and CYP3A18 mRNA levels were not affected by dexamethasone treatment, and were hardly detectable after three days of cultivation. CYP3A enzymatic activity was also induced in cultured hepatocytes (approximately 6-fold) after addition of dexamethasone. In vivo, CYP3A1 mRNA levels increased 45-fold after dexamethasone administration. However, in contrast to the situation in cultured hepatocytes, CYP3A2 and CYP3A18 were also induced, albeit to a lesser extent (4- and 7-fold elevated mRNA levels, respectively). We conclude that the selective induction of CYP3A1 in dexamethasone-treated rat hepatocytes allows the study of biotransformation reactions by CYP3A1, without interference by any of the other CYP3A isoenzymes. Vitamin A is required for female reproduction. Rodent uterine cells are able to synthesize retinoic acid (RA), the active vitamin A derivative, and express RA receptors. Here, we report that two RA-synthesizing enzymes [aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2)] and a cytochrome P450 (Cyp26) that metabolizes vitamin A and RA into more polar metabolites exhibit dynamic expression patterns in the mouse uterus, both during the ovarian cycle and during early pregnancy. Aldh1 expression is up-regulated during diestrus and proestrus in the uterine glands, whereas Raldh2 is highly induced in the endometrial stroma in metestrus. Cyp26 expression, which is not detectable during the normal ovarian cycle, is strongly induced in the uterine luminal epithelium, 24 h after human CG hormonal administration. Raldh2 stromal expression also strongly responds to gonadotropin (PMSG and human CG) induction. Furthermore, Raldh2 expression can be hormonally induced in stromal cells of the vagina and cervix. All three enzymes exhibit differential expression profiles during early pregnancy. Aldh1 glandular expression is sharply induced at 2.5 gestational days, whereas Raldh2 stromal expression increases more steadily until the implantation phase. Cyp26 epithelial expression is strongly induced between 3.5-4.5 gestational days, i.e. when the developing blastocysts colonize the uterine lumen. These data suggest a need for precise regulation of RA synthesis and/or metabolism, in both cycling and pregnant uterus. We have isolated the chick and mouse homologs of human aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 (ALDH6) that encode a third cytosolic retinaldehyde-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase. In both chick and mouse embryos, strong expression is observed in the sensory neuroepithelia of the head. In situ hybridization analysis in chick shows compartmentalized expression primarily in the ventral retina, olfactory epithelium, and otic vesicle; additional sites of expression include the isthmus, Rathke's pouch, posterior spinal cord interneurons, and developing limbs. Recombinant chick ALDH6 has a K(0.5) = 0.26 microm, V(max) = 48.4 nmol/min/mg and exhibits strong positive cooperativity (H = 1.9) toward all-trans-retinaldehyde; mouse ALDH6 has similar kinetic parameters. Expression constructs can confer 1000-fold increased sensitivity to retinoic acid receptor-dependent signaling from retinol in transient transfections experiments. The localization of ALDH6 to the developing sensory neuroepithelia of the eye, nose, and ear and discreet sites within the CNS suggests a role for RA signaling during primary neurogenesis at these sites. We have found that the expression of five 14-3-3 protein isoforms is induced during the retinoic acid (RA)-mediated differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. The induced expression of the 14-3-3 proteins is presumed to have a role in enhancing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity during RA-mediated F9 cell differentiation, because using genetically engineered budding yeast we showed that these isoforms enhanced the signaling in the MAPK cascade mainly through the interaction with Raf-1. Then we assessed the role of increased MAPK activity in F9 cell differentiation by interfering with signaling in the MAPK cascade in F9 cells. The exogenous expression of dominant-negative MEK1 efficiently abrogated RA-mediated induction of the cytokeratins EndoA and EndoC in the F9 cells. These results suggest that the 14-3-3 proteins play a role in the efficient induction of the cytokeratins during F9 cell differentiation through their signal enhancing activity in the MAPK cascade. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) plays a major role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA), a hormone required for several essential life processes. Recent evidence, using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-null mouse, suggests that elevated hepatic RA down-regulates ALDH1 in a unique feedback pathway to control RA biosynthesis. To determine the mechanism of suppression of the ALDH1 gene by RA, transactivation studies were carried out in Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cells. RA decreased expression of an ALDH1-CAT construct containing -2536 base pairs of DNA upstream of the transcription start site. Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) transactivates the ALDH1 gene promoter through a complex with an RA response-like element (RARE) located at -91/-75 bp, which bound to the RARalpha/retinoid X receptor beta heterodimer. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta) also transactivates the ALDH1 gene promoter through a CCAAT box located 3' and directly adjacent to the RARE, and the ALDH1 gene is down-regulated in C/EBPbeta-null mouse liver. Exposure of Hepa-1 cells to RA results in a decrease in C/EBPbeta mRNA levels; however, there was no difference in mRNA and protein levels between wild-type and AHR-null mouse liver. These data support a model in which the RARalpha and C/EBPbeta activate the ALDH1 gene promoter through the RARE and C/EBP response elements, and in Hepa-1 cells, high levels of RA inhibit this activation by decreasing cellular levels of C/EBPbeta. To study the role of nitric oxide (NO) derived from the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway in the induction of apoptosis in the rheumatoid joint. Joint tissue was obtained from four rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, three osteoarthritis patients and two patients with a fractured neck of the femur (NOF#), and apoptotic cells were identified in cryosections using the TUNEL (terminal dUTP nick end labelling) assay. Expression of iNOS was determined using immunohistochemistry. NO synthesis and the effect of NOS inhibitors on apoptosis levels were studied in explant cultures of RA cartilage and synovium. Numbers of apoptotic cells were greatly increased in rheumatoid synovium and articular cartilage compared with NOF# and osteoarthritic synovium. Immunohistochemistry showed co-localization of iNOS staining and apoptosis in the synovial lining layer and articular cartilage. The NOS inhibitor L-NMMA (L-N(G)-monomethylarginine) strongly inhibited apoptosis in explant cultures of synovium and cartilage, and this was reversed by the NO donor S-nitroso-acetyl-penicillamine. This study indicates that NO acts as a mediator of apoptosis in RA and suggests that NOS inhibitors reverse this process. Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a spectrum of toxic effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) effects, because of inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown. To determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs. The Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000. Three hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted. Incidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period. For all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use. In this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly. JAMA. 2000;284:1247-1255 The catabolism of retinoic acid (RA) is an essential mechanism for restricting the exposure of specific tissues and cells to RA. We recently reported the identification of a RA-inducible cytochrome P450 [P450RAI(CYP26)], in zebrafish, mouse, and human, which was shown to be responsible for RA catabolism. P450RAI exhibits a complex spatiotemporal pattern of expression during development and is highly inducible by exogenous RA treatment in certain tissues and cell lines. Sequence analysis of the proximal upstream region of the P450RAI promoter revealed a high degree of conservation between zebrafish, mouse, and human. This region of the promoter contains a canonical retinoic acid response element (5'-AGT-TCA-(n)5-AGTTCA-3'), embedded within a 32-bp region (designated R1), which is conserved among all three species. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using this element demonstrated the specific binding of murine retinoic acid receptor-gamma (RARgamma) and retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha) proteins. Transient transfection experiments with the mouse P450RAI promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene showed transcriptional activation in the presence of RA in HeLa, Cos-1, and F9 wild-type cells. This activation, as well as basal promoter activity, was abolished upon mutation of the RARE. Deletion and mutational analyses of the P450RAI promoter, as well as DNase I footprinting studies, revealed potential binding sites for several other proteins in conserved regions of the promoter. Also, two conserved 5'-TAAT-3' sequences flanking the RARE were investigated for their potential importance in P450RAI promoter activity. Moreover, these studies revealed an essential requirement for a G-rich element (designated GGRE), located just upstream of the RARE, for RA inducibility. This element was demonstrated to form complexes with Sp1 and Sp3 using nuclear extracts from either murine F9 or P19 cells. Together, these results indicate that the P450RAI-RARE is atypical in that conserved flanking sequences may play a very important role in regulating RA inducibility and expression of P450RAI(CYP26). Inflammatory genes may be unevenly expressed in different heart chambers. Biopsies were taken simultaneously from the right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), and left ventricle (LV) of 19 patients before cardioplegic arrest during open heart surgery. The mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (iNOS and eNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), E-selectin (CD62E), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and its ligand CD18, and CD25 was evaluated with semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of TNFalpha mRNA was higher in RA than LA and LV (p<0.05), whereas IL-1beta was more expressed in LA than RA (p<0.05), which was higher than LV (p<0.0001). There were no significant regional differences in the expression of ICAM-1, CD62E, CD25, iNOS, and eNOS. CD18 was higher in RA than LA (p<0.05); ET-1 was more expressed in RA than LV (p<0.04). Patients with stable angina had no expression of eNOS. Gene expression of inflammatory mediators was detected in the hearts of patients with different cardiovascular disorders, and was unevenly distributed in different heart chambers. Cardiac biopsies should be taken from the same site. To determine the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of celecoxib, naproxen, and placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). An analysis of 5, 12-week, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled clinical trials was conducted. In these trials, patients were randomized to: naproxen 500 mg bid (n = 1,099), placebo (n = 1,136), celecoxib 50 mg bid (n = 690) (subtherapeutic dose), celecoxib 100 mg (n = 1,131) or 200 mg bid (n = 1,125) (therapeutic dose), or celecoxib 400 mg bid (n = 434) (supratherapeutic dosage). The incidence and time until moderate to severe abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and any of the aforementioned 3 upper GI symptoms (composite endpoint) were determined using time-to-event analysis. The cumulative incidences of moderate to severe abdominal pain, dyspepsia, or nausea (composite endpoint) were: naproxen 500 mg (12.0%; 95% CI 9.9%-14.0%), celecoxib 50 mg bid (7.1%; 95% CI 5.0%-9.2%), celecoxib 100 mg bid (7.8%; 95% CI 6.0%-9.5%), celecoxib 200 mg bid (8.1%; 95% CI 6.4%-9.9%), celecoxib 400 mg bid (6.0%; 95% CI 3.6%-8.4%), and placebo (8.5%; 95% CI 6.5%-10.8%). After controlling for independent predictors of the composite endpoint, relative risks (RR) for the various treatments relative to naproxen 500 mg bid were: celecoxib 50 mg (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.77; p < 0.001), celecoxib 100 mg (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45-0.80; p < 0.001), celecoxib 200 mg bid (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.47-0.83; p = 0.001), celecoxib 400 mg bid (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.89; p = 0.015), and placebo (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.47-0.85; p = 0.002). After controlling for independent predictors of the composite endpoint, celecoxib treatment group patients did not differ from placebo patients when reporting the composite endpoint, with p values ranging from 0.40 to 0.96. The upper GI tolerability of celecoxib is superior to naproxen. A dose-response relationship between celecoxib and upper GI symptoms was not apparent. Cytochrome P4503A7 (CYP3A7) is the primary CYP isoform expressed in human fetal hepatic microsomes, and its potential role in human embryotoxicity has attracted considerable investigative attention. In this study, we investigated the 4-hydroxylation of highly embryotoxic and teratogenic retinoic acids (RA) as catalyzed by human fetal liver microsomes (HFLM) and demonstrated that CYP3A7 is an efficient RA hydroxylase. When all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), or 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) were incubated with HFLM (54-109 gestational days) plus NADPH, each of these three retinoic acids was rapidly converted to its corresponding 4-hydroxy and 4-oxo metabolites. The reactions were strongly inhibited by CO (CO:O(2), 80:20) and were NADPH-dependent, indicating that the reactions were catalyzed by P450 isoenzymes. At 54 to 89 gestational days, 4-hydroxylase activities were relatively low. However, at gestational days 96 to 109, activities were much higher. Selective inhibitors were employed for elucidation of the roles of individual CYP isoenzymes in HFLM. alpha-Naphthoflavone, paclitaxel, and diethyldithiocarbamate showed little or no effects on HFLM-catalyzed reactions, indicating that CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1 did not play significant roles in the catalysis. By contrast, troleandomycin strongly inhibited the reaction (70-75% inhibition), suggesting that CYP3A7 was primarily responsible for the observed catalysis. It was also discovered that CYP3A7 SUPERSOMES efficiently catalyzed the 4-hydroxylations of tRA, 9cRA, and 13cRA. Because 4-hydroxylated metabolites of RA are much less potent embryotoxins and teratogens, the results indicated that the 4-hydroxylation of RA, catalyzed prenatally by CYP3A7, might play an important role in protecting the human fetus against RA-induced embryotoxicity. Hirsutism, the presence of terminal (coarse) hairs in females in a male-like pattern, affects between 5% and 10% of women. Of the sex steroids, androgens are the most important in determining the type and distribution of hairs over the human body. Under the influence of androgens hair follicles that are producing vellus-type hairs can be stimulated to begin producing terminal hairs (i.e., terminalized). The activity of local 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-RA) determines to a great extent the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and consequently the effect of androgens on hair follicles. While there are two distinct 5alpha-RA isoenzymes, type 1 and type 2, the activity of these in the facial or abdominal skin of hirsute women remains to be determined. Although the definition of idiopathic hirsutism (IH) has been an evolving process, the diagnosis of IH should be applied only to hirsute patients with normal ovulatory function and circulating androgen levels. A history of regular menses is not sufficient to exclude ovulatory dysfunction, since up to 40% of eumenorrheic hirsute women are anovulatory. The diagnosis of IH, when strictly defined, will include less than 20% of all hirsute women. The pathophysiology of IH is presumed to be a primary increase in skin 5alpha-RA activity, probably of both isoenzyme types, and possibly an alteration in androgen receptor function. Therapeutically, these patients respond to antiandrogen or 5alpha-RA inhibitor therapy. Pharmacological suppression of ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion may be of additional, albeit limited, benefit. New therapeutic strategies such as laser epilation or the use of new biological response modifiers may play an important role in offering a more effective means of treatment to remove unwanted hair. Further investigations into the genetic, molecular, and metabolic aspects of this disorder, including only well defined patients, are needed. Human type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) is induced in association with several immune-mediated inflammatory conditions. We have evaluated the effect of sPLA2-IIA on PG production in primary synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At concentrations found in the synovial fluid of RA patients, exogenously added sPLA2-IIA dose-dependently amplified TNF-alpha-stimulated PGE2 production by cultured synovial fibroblasts. Enhancement of TNF-alpha-stimulated PGE2 production in synovial cells was accompanied by increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-alpha. Blockade of COX-2 enzyme activity with the selective inhibitor NS-398 prevented both TNF-alpha-stimulated and sPLA2-IIA-amplified PGE2 production without affecting COX-2 protein induction. However, both sPLA2-IIA-amplified PGE2 production and enhanced COX-2 expression were blocked by the sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727. Colocalization studies using triple-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that sPLA2-IIA and cPLA2-alpha are coexpressed with COX-2 in discrete populations of CD14-positive synovial macrophages and synovial tissue fibroblasts from RA patients. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby the enhanced expression of sPLA2-IIA by RA synovial cells up-regulates TNF-alpha-mediated PG production via superinduction of COX-2. Therefore, sPLA2-IIA may be a critical modulator of cytokine-mediated synovial inflammation in RA. The homeobox gene Hoxa-1 is transcriptionally regulated by retinoic acid (RA) and encodes a transcription factor which has been shown to play important roles in cell differentiation and embryogenesis. In order to clone and characterize target genes of Hoxa-1, we utilized differential hybridization screening and cDNA subtractive hybridization methods to identify genes which are differentially expressed in F9-10, a murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cell line which expresses high levels of exogenous Hoxa-1, compared to F9 wild-type stem cells, which do not express endogenous Hoxa-1 mRNA in the absence of RA. Twenty-eight candidate genes were identified; these genes encode very diverse proteins, including signaling molecules such as BMP-4, the enzyme superoxide dismutase, the cell adhesion molecule cadherin-6, proteins involved in gene transcription such as HMG-1 and SAP18, homeodomain-containing proteins Gbx-2 and Evx-2, and cell cycle regulatory proteins such as the retinoblastoma binding protein-2. Clone 104 encodes a novel protein; the expression of the clone 104 mRNA is also regulated in a fashion very similar to that of the exogenous Hoxa-1 gene in another F9 cell line, called F9-tet-Hoxa1-8, in which the exogenous Hoxa-1 mRNA expression is tightly regulated by a Tet-off gene expression system. These data strongly suggest that clone 104 is a direct downstream target of the transcription factor Hoxa-1. The cDNA sequence of clone 104 is related to that of human ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase T. Further characterization of these putative Hoxa-1 target genes will aid in delineating the functions of the Hoxa-1 protein in the differentiation processes which occur during embryogenesis. Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity is reduced in some conditions, including rheumatic diseases, but the aetiology and significance remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between serum CK activity and other muscle enzymes, muscle mass, renal function, steroid use and disease activity in patients with rheumatic diseases. Serum CK activity was measured in sera from 498 patients with rheumatic diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 145), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 31), spondyloarthropathies (SpA, n = 35), polyarthralgia/arthritis (Poly, n = 74), miscellaneous group (MI, n = 46), and in non-inflammatory arthropathies (NIA, n = 167) as controls. Serum CK level was significantly reduced in RA (45.4 +/- 1.9 IU/l), SLE (46.4 +/- 4.2 IU/l), SpA (64.7 +/- 5.6 IU/l) and MI (63.4 +/- 4.8 IU/l), but not in poly (70.2 +/- 3.1 IU/l), compared to controls (78.9 +/- 2.4 IU/l) (P < 0.05). CK values correlated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), body mass index (BMI) and platelets (Plat) in RA; ESR and haemoglobin (Hb) in SLE, AST, ESR and Hb in SpA; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), AST, ESR and Hb in Poly; LDH, AST, ESR, Hb and Ccr in MI; and LDH, AST and ESR in controls. In all patients with rheumatic diseases CK level was significantly correlated with LDH, AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and BMI and prednisolone dose, but not with Ccr, age and disease duration. In conclusion, our data support the possibility that reduced CK activity is inversely correlated with inflammatory activity and correlated with other muscle enzymes, muscle mass and steroid use, but not with renal function, age and disease duration in rheumatic diseases. It has been suggested that enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic antioxidant systems are impaired in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hence patients are exposed to oxidant stress. This study aimed to establish whether this is really the case. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 24 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 20 controls. The activities of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and xanthine oxidase (XO) enzymes and malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidant resistant (OR) and non-enzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA) values were measured in both groups. Patients with RA had higher SOD and XO activities and MDA levels than did the controls. However, NSSA and OR levels were found to be decreased, and CAT and GSH-Px activities unchanged in the study group. Results suggest that excessive free radical production through the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system is the primary factor in rheumatoid arthritis, rather than an impaired antioxidant system. The therapeutic use of XO enzyme inhibitors and some antioxidants can be beneficial in this regard. To investigate the prevalence and clinical relevance of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes of antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) and antilactoferrin (LF) antibodies in collagen diseases, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to detect the Ig isotypes of both antibodies. The purified proteins of MPO and LF were used as two major representative antigens for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) with a perinuclear staining pattern by an indirect immunofluorescent technique. We examined 131 serum samples from 79 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 32 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 14 with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), 6 with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), and 5 with idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis who served as positive controls and 36 healthy subjects who served as controls. A limited number of patients with RA (4-10%), SLE (6-9%), and PSS (7-14%) but not PM/DM showed positive IgG or IgA anti-MPO antibody (MPO-ANCA) but not IgM MPO-ANCA. However, 10-20% of RA, 40-60% of SLE, 20-36% of PSS but none of the PM/DM patients showed positive IgG, IgA, or IgM anti-LF antibody (LF-ANCA). MPO- and LF-ANCA positivity in RA patients was correlated with markers of disease activity such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum Ig levels. IgG LF-ANCA but not MPO-ANCA positivity in SLE patients also was correlated with the disease activity index but not with clinical features. Neither MPO- nor LF-ANCA positivity in PSS patients was correlated with any clinical features. Overall, both MPO- and LF-ANCA were found mainly in RA, SLE, and PSS patients but not in PM/DM patients. The Ig isotypes of MPO- and LF-ANCA frequently belonged to both IgG and IgA and rarely to the IgM class. Both MPO- and LF-ANCA positivity reflected disease activity in RA and SLE rather than specific organ involvement. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and its complexes with transition metals on the bladder cancer cell line EJ. Retinoic acid complexes with transition metals Cu, Co, Zn, and Ni were prepared. Cell proliferation was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in the presence of RA or its complexes with transition metals Cu, Co, Zn, and Ni Â¿Cu(RA)2.3H2O, Co(RA)2.3H2O, Zn(RA)2.4H2O, and Ni(RA)2.3H2OÂ¿. Colony formation in soft agar culture, A agglutination reaction, and lactic acid dehydrogenase isoenzyme assay were performed in the cells treated with these drugs to estimate the induced differentiation. p53 or c-Ha-ras expression in drug-treated cells was assayed by ABC immunocytochemistry technique. The results demonstrate that EJ cells treated with the drugs become less confluent and tend to exhibit normal characteristics. Although RA and its complexes showed inhibition to proliferation of EJ cells at the concentrations of 10(-6) mmol/l, the inhibition induced by Ni(RA)2.3H2O was much more marked than that by RA. EJ cells were growth inhibited by RA or Ni(RA)2.3H2O from 48 to 96 h at the concentration of 10(-8) mol/l. The levels of LDH4 and LDH5 in the cells were greatly increased by RA. Nevertheless, Ni(RA)2.3H2O did not affect LDH isoenzyme in EJ cells. The number of colony formations of EJ cells in soft agar culture was decreased by RA or Ni(RA)2.3H2O. The percentage of colony formation in soft agar culture was much lower in EJ cells treated with Ni(RA)2.3H2O than with RA. The required concentration of A agglutination reaction was more increased for EJ cells treated with RA or Ni(RA)2.3H2O than for the control and was further increased in cells treated with Ni(RA)2.3H2O. Mutant p53 expression was more decreased in the EJ cells treated with RA or Ni(RA)2.3H2O than in the control. Although RA at the concentration of 10(-6) mmol/l caused lower p21 expression, Ni(RA)2.3H2O did not affect p21 expression in EJ cells. Therefore, RA and its transition metal complexes have a potential use in the treatment of bladder cancer. Antimicrobial effects of nitric oxide (NO) have been demonstrated in vitro against a variety of infectious pathogens, yet in vivo evidence of a potential therapeutic role for exogenous NO as an antimicrobial agent is limited. Thus, we assessed the effects of inhaled NO on pulmonary infection, leukocyte infiltration, and NO synthase (NOS) activity in a rat model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Controlled animal study. Research laboratory of an academic institution. Male Sprague-Dawley rats. After intratracheal instillation of either P. aeruginosa or saline (sham), rats were randomly exposed to either 40 ppm of inhaled NO or room air (RA) for 24 hrs before they were killed. Inhaled NO in pneumonia rats markedly reduced pulmonary bacterial load (0.02+/-0.01% vs. 0.99+/-0.59% of bacterial input in pneumonia with room air, p < .05) and pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of leukocyte infiltration (21.7+/-3.8 vs. 55.0+/-8.1 units in pneumonia with room air, p < .05), but had no effect on systemic hemodynamics or gas exchange. Pneumonia was associated with enhanced pulmonary NOS activity (8.8+/-2.4 vs. 0.2+/-0.1 pmol citrulline/min/mg protein in sham, p < .01) and increased plasma levels of nitrites/nitrates (NOx-; 45+/-7 vs. 16+/-3 micromol/L in sham, p < .01). Inhaled NO therapy attenuated the pneumonia-induced increase in pulmonary calcium-independent NOS activity (p < .05) and markedly increased plasma NOx- levels. Exposure of P. aeruginosa in culture to 40 ppm of ambient NO confirmed a delayed antibacterial effect of NO in vitro. Inhaled NO has an important antibacterial effect both in vitro and in vivo against P. aeruginosa and is associated with reduced pulmonary leukocyte infiltration in vivo. These results in a rat model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia suggest that future studies should address the possible clinical effects of inhaled NO therapy in pneumonia. We investigated the catecholaminergic nature of cultured hNT neurons previously treated either for 4 or 5 weeks with retinoic acid (RA). There were significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons (60%) in cultures treated for 4 weeks with RA compared to 5 week-treated cultures (</=15%). Furthermore, numerous TH-positive hNT cells were also immunoreactive to dopamine transporter (DAT), dopamine receptor (D2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (AHD-2), an enzyme exclusively expressed by dopaminergic (DA) ventral mesencephalic (VM) precursors. Thus this cell line has all the necessary cellular machinery to produce functional DA neurons and therefore is a good alternative tissue source to fetal VM. Most retinoic acid (RA) in the embryonic mouse is generated by three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs). RALDH1 (also called E1, AHD2 or ALDH1) is expressed in the dorsal retina, and RALDH2 (V2, ALDH11) generates most RA in the embryonic trunk. The third one, RALDH3 (V1), synthesizes the bulk of RA in the head of the early embryo. We show here that RALDH3 is a mouse homologue to ALDH6, an aldehyde dehydrogenase cloned from adult human salivary gland (Hsu, L.C., Chang, W.-C., Hiraoka, L., Hsien, C.-L., 1994. Molecular cloning, genomic organization, and chromosomal localization of an additional human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, ALDH6. Genomics 24, 333-341), which was recently reported to act as a RALDH (Yoshida, A., Rzhetsky, A., Hsu, L.C., Chang, C., 1998. Human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family. Eur. J. Biochem. 251, 549-557). RALDH3 expression begins in the surface ectoderm over the optic recess. In rapidly changing expression patterns it labels the appearance of several ectodermal structures: it marks the formation of the lens and the olfactory organ from ectodermal placodes, and it delineates the beginning eyelid field. Within the optic vesicle, RALDH3 is expressed in the ventral retina and the dorsal pigment epithelium. In the telencephalon, RALDH3 is expressed at high levels in the lateral part of the ganglionic eminence. From here it extends via the piriform cortex into the lower part of the septum. Of the three RALDHs, RALDH3 shows the strongest predilection for epithelia. Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in the interactions between tumor cells and host matrix, including those involved in invasion and spread of tumor cells. Because joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mediated by the invasive growth of synovial tissue through its attachment to cartilage, we examined the expression of OPN in the synovia of patients with RA and the effect of OPN on the production of collagenase 1 in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and articular chondrocytes. The expression of OPN messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in synovia from 10 RA patients was examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Synovial fibroblasts from RA patients and articular chondrocytes from patients without joint disease were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of OPN, and levels of collagenase 1 in the culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of OPN mRNA and protein was observed in 9 of 10 specimens obtained from patients with RA. OPN was expressed in the synovial lining and sublining layer and at the interface of cartilage and invading synovium. Double labeling revealed that the majority of OPN-expressing cells were positive for the fibroblast-specific enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase and negative for the macrophage marker CD68, while only a few, single OPN-expressing cells were positive for CD68 at sites of synovial invasion into cartilage. OPN staining was not observed in lymphocytic infiltrates or leukocyte common antigen (CD45)-positive cells. Three of 3 cultures of human articular chondrocytes secreted detectable basal amounts of collagenase, with a dose-dependent increase upon OPN stimulation, while synovial fibroblast cultures produced much lower levels of collagenase, with only 2 of 4 fibroblast cultures responding in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that OPN produced by synovial fibroblasts in the synovial lining layer and at sites of cartilage invasion not only mediates attachment of these cells to cartilage, but also contributes to matrix degradation in RA by stimulating the secretion of collagenase 1 in articular chondrocytes. In songbirds, aromatase (estrogen synthase) activity and mRNA are readily detectable in the brain. This neural aromatization presumably provides estrogen to steroid-sensitive targets via autocrine, paracrine, and synaptic mechanisms. The location of immunoreactive protein, however, has been difficult to describe completely, particularly in distal dendrites, axons, and terminals of the forebrain. Here we describe the neuroanatomical distribution of aromatase in the zebra finch by using a novel antibody raised specifically against zebra finch aromatase. The distribution of aromatase-positive somata in the zebra finch brain is in excellent agreement with previous reports. Additionally, this antibody reveals elaborate, spinous dendritic arbors, fine-beaded axons, and punctate terminals of telencephalic neurons that may synthesize estrogen. Some of these axon-like fibers extend into the high vocal center (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) in males and females, suggesting a role for presynaptic aromatization in cellular processes within these loci. Adult males have more aromatase-positive fibers in the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM) and the preoptic area (POA) compared to females, despite the lack of detectable sex differences in the number of immunoreactive somata at these loci. Thus, the compartmentalization of aromatase in dendrites and axons may serve a sexually dimorphic function in the songbird. Finally, in adult males, aromatase expression is down-regulated by circulating estradiol in the hippocampus, but not in the NCM or POA. The distribution of aromatase suggests a role for aromatization in the regulation of pre- and postsynaptic function in steroid sensitive areas of the songbird forebrain. Leflunomide (Arava) has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The drug, due to its protective effects on structural joint damage, has been classified as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Leflunomide is structurally dissimilar from other drugs currently used to treat RA and exhibits a different mechanism of action. It has shown to be protective in a variety of animal models of arthritis and autoimmunity based on its immunomodulatory activity. Leflunomide is rapidly converted in vivo to its pharmacologically active metabolite A77 1726. This metabolite is a potent non-cytotoxic inhibitor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of uridine monophosphate (UMP). Activated lymphocytes depend on the pyrimidine de novo syntheses to fulfill their metabolic needs for clonal expansion and terminal differentiation into effector cells. De novo synthesis of pyrimidines is not only essential to provide precursors for new RNA and DNA synthesis, but also for phospholipid synthesis and the pyrimidine sugars necessary for protein glycosylation, which support the massive expansion in membrane biosynthesis to form daughter cells. This mechanism likely contributes to leflunomide's action as a DMARD in RA and other autoimmune diseases. This review is a summary of current in vivo and in vitro data, focussing primarily on the mechanism of action of leflunomide in RA. Ascorbate is readily oxidized in aqueous solution by ascorbate oxidase. Ascorbate radicals are formed, which disproportionate to ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid. Addition of erythrocytes with increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations decreased the oxidation of ascorbate in a concentration-dependent manner. Concurrently, it was found, utilizing electron spin resonance spectroscopy, that extracellular ascorbate radical levels were decreased. Control experiments showed that these results could not be explained by leakage of ascorbate from the cells, inactivation of ascorbate oxidase, or oxygen depletion. Thus, this means that intracellular ascorbate is directly responsible for the decreased oxidation of extracellular ascorbate. Exposure of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes to higher levels of extracellular ascorbate radicals resulted in the detection of intracellular ascorbate radicals. Moreover, efflux of dehydroascorbic acid was observed under these conditions. These data confirm the view that intracellular ascorbate donates electrons to extracellular ascorbate free radical via a plasma membrane redox system. Such a redox system enables the cells to effectively counteract oxidative processes and thereby prevent depletion of extracellular ascorbate. Little is known about how retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, utilization and metabolism are regulated in the embryonic lung and how these activities relate to lung pattern formation. Here we report that early lung bud formation and subsequent branching morphogenesis are characterized by distinct stages of RA signaling. At the onset of lung development RA signaling is ubiquitously activated in primary buds, as shown by expression of the major RA-synthesizing enzyme, RALDH-2 and activation of a RARE-lacZ transgene. Nevertheless, further airway branching appears to require downregulation of RA pathways by decreased synthesis, increased RA degradation in the epithelium via P450RAI-mediated metabolism, and inhibition of RA signaling in the mesenchyme by COUPTF-II expression. These mechanisms controlling local RA signaling may be critical for normal branching, since we show that manipulating RA levels in vitro to maintain RA signaling activated as in the initial stage, leads to an immature lung phenotype characterized by failure to form typical distal buds. We show that this phenotype likely results from RA interfering with the establishment of a distal signaling center, altering levels and distribution of Fgf10 and Bmp4, genes that are essential for distal lung formation. Furthermore, RA upregulates P450RAI expression, suggesting the presence of feedback mechanisms controlling RA availability. Our study illustrates the importance of regional mechanisms that control RA availability and utilization for correct expression of pattern regulators and normal morphogenesis during lung development. To investigate signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis during the early phase of neurogenesis, we employed PCC7-Mz1 cells, which cease to proliferate and begin to differentiate into a stable pattern of neurons, astroglial cells, and fibroblasts upon incubation with retinoic acid (RA). As part of lineage determination, a sizable fraction of RA-treated cultures die by apoptosis. Applying natural long-chain C(16)-ceramides as well as membrane-permeable C(2)/C(6)-ceramide analogs caused apoptosis, whereas the biologically nonactive C(2)-dihydroceramide did not. Treating PCC7-Mz1 stem cells with a neutral sphingomyelinase or with the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine elevated the endogenous ceramide levels and concomitantly induced apoptosis. Addition of RA caused an increase in ceramide levels within 3-5 h, which reached a maximum (up to 3.5-fold of control) between days 1 and 3 of differentiation. Differentiated PCC7-Mz1 cells did not respond with ceramide formation and apoptosis to RA treatment. The acidic sphingomyelinase contributed only weakly and the neutral Mg(2+)-dependent and Mg(2+)-independent sphingomyelinases not at all to the RA-mediated production of ceramides. However, ceramide increase was sensitive to the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B(1), suggesting a crucial role for the de novo synthesis pathway. Enzymatic assays revealed that ceramide synthase activity remained unaltered, whereas serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a key enzyme in ceramide synthesis, was activated approximately 2.5-fold by RA treatment. Activation of SPT seemed to be mediated via a post-translational mechanism because levels of the mRNAs coding for the two SPT subunits were unaffected. Expression of marker proteins shows that ceramide regulates apoptosis, rather than differentiation, during early neural differentiation. To investigate the regulation of whole-blood cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-2 and COX-1) activities by methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Whole blood was withdrawn from nine healthy volunteers, 12 RA patients treated with MTX (RA/MTX) and six RA patients treated with chloroquine (RA/CQ). COX-1 activity was quantified as platelet thromboxane B(2) production in unstimulated blood and COX-2 activity was measured as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in whole blood stimulated with LPS. Thromboxane B(2) and PGE(2) were measured by radioimmunoassay. We studied the drug effect in vitro by direct incubation of MTX with blood obtained from normal donors. Ex vivo assays were performed with blood collected from RA/MTX and RA/CQ patients. The influence of serum factors on enzyme activities was analysed in blood collected from normal donors and incubated with RA/MTX, autologous or heterologous serum. In vitro assays showed no direct action of MTX on the activity of either enzyme. Assays performed with blood from RA/MTX patients showed preferential inhibition of COX-2 activity (PGE(2) = 10.11 +/- 2.42 ng/ml) when compared with blood of normal donors (PGE(2) = 37.7 +/- 4.36 ng/ml; P = 0.001). Inhibition of COX-2 activity was also observed when blood of normal donors was co-incubated with RA/MTX serum. Our results clearly show that the anti-inflammatory action of low-dose MTX is partly mediated by a serum factor induced by MTX or a MTX metabolite that preferentially inhibits the activity of COX-2. Dynamic expression patterns of four retinoid-metabolizing enzymes create rapidly changing retinoic acid (RA) patterns in the emerging eye anlage of the mouse. First, a RA-rich ventral zone is set up, then a RA-poor dorsal zone, and finally a tripartite organization consisting of dorsal and ventral RA-rich zones separated by a horizontal RA-poor stripe. This subdivision of the retina into three RA concentration zones is directly visible as beta-galactosidase labeling patterns in retinas of RA-reporter mice. Because the axons of retinal ganglion cells transport the reporter product anterogradely, the central projections from dorsal and ventral retina can be visualized as two heavily labeled axon bundles. Comparisons of the axonal labeling with physiologic recordings of visual topography in the adult mouse show that the labeled axons represent the upper and the lower visual fields. The RA-poor stripe develops into a broad horizontal zone of higher visual acuity. Comparisons of the retina labeling with eye-muscle insertions show that the axis of the RA pattern lines up with the dorsoventral axis of the oculomotor system. These observations indicate that the dorsoventral axis of the embryonic eye anlage determines the functional coordinates of both vision and eye movements in the adult. Some years ago we applied simultaneously an identical regime of selection for late-life reproduction to several normal-lived sister lines (Ra and Rb) so as to produce several selected long-lived sister lines (La and Lb). The long-lived La and Lb sister lines had statistically identical longevity phenotypes and paraquat resistance phenotypes; however, we noticed some statistically different responses of the two strains at the biochemical level. Extensive work with the La strain showed that transcriptional alterations in antioxidant gene expression are robustly associated with its extended longevity. We decided to critically test the assumption of phenotypic equivalence by subjecting the Lb strain to the same series of molecular assays as was the La strain. The two sister strains are characterized by significantly different mechanisms and patterns of antioxidant gene expression, antioxidant enzyme activity, and oxidative damage. We find that the Lb strain appears to depend on the transcriptional activation of different genes than does the La strain, and on a post-translational up-regulation of at least one other antioxidant defense gene. The phenotypic equivalence observed at the organism level need not hold at the molecular genetic level. This finding suggests that there is more than one molecular mechanism by which antioxidant defense genes can bring about an increased resistance to oxidative stress. The theoretical and empirical implications of these findings are discussed. Retinoids, particularly all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), are potent regulators of cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The role of all-trans-RA during development and in the maintenance of adult tissues has been well established. The control of all-trans-RA levels in cells and tissues is regulated by the balance between its biosynthesis and its catabolism to inactive metabolites. The cytochrome P450 enzyme P450RAI (herein renamed P450RAI-1) is partially responsible for this inactivation of all-trans-RA. In this report, we describe the identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of a second related enzyme, P450RAI-2, which is also involved in the specific inactivation of all-trans-RA. Transiently transfected P450RAI-2 can convert all-trans-RA to more polar metabolites including 4-oxo-, 4-OH-, and 18-OH-all-trans-RA. Competition experiments with other retinoids suggest that all-trans-RA is the preferred substrate. The high level of expression of P450RAI-2, particularly in the cerebellum and pons of human adult brain, suggests a unique role for this enzyme in the protection of specific tissues from exposure to retinoids. It is unclear what mechanisms lead to the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's or other human brain diseases. Some brain cholinergic neurons express neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS), which produces a free radical that has been implicated in some forms of neurodegeneration. We investigated nNOS expression and NO toxicity in SN56 cells, a clonal cholinergic model derived from the medial septum of the mouse basal forebrain. We show here that, in addition to expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), SN56 cells express nNOS. Treatment of SN56 cells with retinoic acid (RA; 1 microM) for 48 h increased ChAT mRNA (+126%), protein (+88%), and activity (+215%) and increased nNOS mRNA (+98%), protein (+400%), and activity (+15%). After RA treatment, SN56 cells became vulnerable to NO excess generated with S-nitro-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) and exhibited increased nuclear DNA fragmentation that was blocked with a caspase-3 inhibitor. Treatment with dexamethasone, which largely blocked the RA-mediated increase in nNOS expression, or inhibition of nNOS activity with methylthiocitrulline strongly potentiated the apoptotic response to SNAP in RA-treated SN56 cells. Caspase-3 activity was reduced when SNAP was incubated with cells or cell lysates, suggesting that NO can directly inhibit the protease. Thus, whereas RA treatment converts SN56 cells to a proapoptotic state sensitive to NO excess, endogenously produced NO appears to be anti-apoptotic, possibly by tonically inhibiting caspase-3. Pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroids, is synthesized by CNS structures. The synthesis requires an obligatory step involving cholesterol transport to mitochondrial cytochrome P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage (cytP450scc), although the underlying mechanism(s) are still mostly unknown. We used the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line to investigate cytP450scc expression and activity and to establish a role of cytoskeleton in pregnenolone synthesis. Immunocytochemical and biochemical approaches revealed that undifferentiated as well as differentiated cells either by retinoic acid (RA) or phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), possess cytP450scc and rapidly synthesize pregnenolone in the presence of a NADPH-generating system. The newly neurosteroid formation by SH-SY5Y cells was increased by 22R-hydroxycholesterol and blocked by the cytP450scc inhibitor, aminoglutethimide. When trilostane was used to inhibit 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase catalyzing pregnenolone conversion into progesterone, a higher pregnenolone accumulation occurred in TPA-differentiated cells than in RA-differentiated ones. Although SU 10603, a blocker of 17alpha-hydroxylase/c17,20-lyase enzyme involved in DHEA formation from pregnenolone, gave rise to an elevated neurosteroid content only in RA-differentiated cells. No difference in pregnenolone levels was found in undifferentiated cells treated with each inhibitor. Thus, differentiation seems to promote pregnenolone-metabolizing enzyme activities that may vary upon phenotypic changes induced by RA or TPA. Treatments of differentiated cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug colchicine and the actin microfilament-altering agent cytochalasin D decreased pregnenolone synthesis without affecting cell viability or cytP450scc amount. Addition of the cell-permeant cholesterol analogue 22R-hydroxycholesterol known to elude cholesterol transport systems induced pregnenolone synthesis, however, indicating that perturbations in cytoskeleton likely affect endogenous cholesterol transport. The relevance of this finding may rest on the observed involvement of cytoskeletal organization in such events as neuronal plasticity, cognitive function and also neurodegenerative disorders in which neurosteroids have been shown to have a part. To investigate the effect of the environmental pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), on retinoic acid-induced teratogenesis, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) dissolved in corn oil (120 mg/kg) was administered orally to pregnant rats at the 11th day of gestation with and without the prior intraperitoneal treatment with 10 mg/kg 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) for 3 days. Dams were killed on the 20th day of pregnancy. The examinations of fetuses revealed that 3-MC barely enough to cause induction of P-450 in pregnant dams had profound embryo-toxic effects: the fetal resorption amounted to approximately 60% of total number of implantations. The fetuses survived weighed less than the control fetuses. All of RA-treated mothers had fetuses with abnormalities, and the main malformations were absence of tail (100%), caudal and sacral malformations (100%), and cleft palate (42%). Pregnant dams received both 3-MC and RA had a reduced severity of tail anomaly (33%), while the rest, 67%, had short vestigial tail. Caudal and sacral malformations were detected but at a milder degree. We did not observe cleft palate in this group. The concurrent treatment of dams with 3-MC and RA led to an increased inducibility of cytochrome P-450 and subsequently, CYP1A1 dependent enzyme activity higher than those observed after the injection of 3-MC alone. UDP-glucuronyl-transferase activity was also markedly induced in concurrent 3-MC and RA group higher than that in 3-MC alone. We suggest that the induction of P-450 and alteration of metabolic enzyme activities may play an important role in reducing the teratogenic potency of RA. However, RA-treatment did not retard the embryo-toxic effect of 3-MC but rather potentiated. Retinoids are multipotent modulators of cellular functions and suppress cytokine-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) in several cell types. We have explored the mechanisms by which retinoic acid (RA) regulates NO production in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which express NOS2 in response to proinflammatory cytokines. RA inhibited interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced NOS2 mRNA expression and NO production. These effects were attenuated by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist CD3106, indicating that they were mediated through retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The synthetic retinoid agonists CD336 (which specifically binds RARalpha) and CD367 (which binds all RARs) but not agonists specific for RARbeta, RARgamma, or RXRs reduced IL-1beta-induced NOS2 expression and NO production. When transfecting VSMC with a 1570-bp NOS2 promoter fragment fused to a luciferase reporter gene, the NOS2 promoter activity was inhibited by RA. These results indicate that retinoids modulate NO production in VSMC via RARalpha, which inhibits the transcription of the NOS2 gene. Patterns of antioxidant gene expression and of oxidative damage were measured throughout the adult life span of a selected long-lived strain (La) of Drosophila melanogaster and compared to that of their normal-lived progenitor strain (Ra). Extended longevity in the La strain is correlated with enhanced antioxidant defense system gene expression, accumulation of CuZnSOD protein, and an increase in ADS enzyme activities. Extended longevity is strongly associated with a significantly increased resistance to oxidative stress. Reverse-selecting this long-lived strain for shortened longevity (RevLa strain) yields a significant decrease in longevity accompanied by reversion to normal levels of its antioxidant defense system gene expression patterns and antioxidant enzyme patterns. The significant effects of forward and reverse selection in these strains seem limited to the ADS enzymes; 11 other enzymes with primarily metabolic functions show no obvious effect of selection on their activity levels whereas six other enzymes postulated to play a role in flux control may actually be involved in NADPH reoxidation and thus support the enhanced activities of the ADS enzymes. Thus, alterations in the longevity of these Drosophila strains are directly correlated with corresponding alterations in; 1) the mRNA levels of certain antioxidant defense system genes; 2) the protein level of at least one antioxidant defense system gene; 3) the activity levels of the corresponding antioxidant defense system enzymes, and 4) the ability of the organism to resist the biological damage arising from oxidative stress. The products of proinflammatory genes such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) initiate many of the events associated with sepsis. Transcription of these genes is subsequently down-regulated, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1 RA) is maintained. Differential expression is associated with endotoxin tolerance, a cellular phenomenon common to sepsis and characterized by reduced proinflammatory gene expression after repeated exposure to lipopolysaccharide. As a model for endotoxin tolerance, we examined the expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in a human promonocyte cell line, THP-1. We observed a 5-fold decrease in COX-2 protein in endotoxin-tolerant cells relative to control cells. In contrast, sIL-1 RA protein increased 5-fold in control and tolerant cells and remained elevated. Decreased COX-2 production is due to repressed transcription and not enhanced mRNA degradation. In addition, COX-2 protein is turned over rapidly. Transcription of sIL-1 RA is also repressed during tolerance. However, sIL-1 RA mRNA is degraded more slowly than COX-2 mRNA, allowing continued synthesis of sIL-1 RA protein that is very stable. These results indicate that differential expression during endotoxin tolerance occurs by transcriptional repression of COX-2 and by protein and mRNA stabilization of sIL-1 RA. To determine whether polymorphism in the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene is associated with susceptibility or disease outcome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used a case-control approach with 153 RA patients and 218 control subjects to examine for any associations between MnSOD genotypes and susceptibility to RA. We also investigated the influence of genotypes on radiologic outcome, as measured using the Larsen score for radiographs of the hands and feet, and on functional outcome, as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire. MnSOD typing was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-based methods. Results were analyzed using multiple regression analysis, with adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. In separate analyses, we corrected for rheumatoid factor (RF) status and/or the presence of the HLA-DRB1 "shared epitope" (SE). We also examined whether radiologic outcome was influenced by interactions between MnSOD and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes. No association between MnSOD genotype and development of RA was found. The MnSOD VV genotype was associated with a significantly higher (P = 0.04) Larsen score (104.4) than MnSOD AA (83.0), while MnSOD AV was associated with an intermediate score (91.8). Correction for RF status had no significant effect on the results of the analysis, but significance was lost (P = 0.09) after correction for the presence of the SE. There was evidence of interaction between the GSTT1 and MnSOD genotypes, with the MnSOD VV/GSTT1-null combination being associated with the highest Larsen score (142.1; P = 0.007 after correction for the SE). Polymorphism in the MnSOD gene is not associated with susceptibility to RA. Our data suggest that MnSOD VV is associated with more severe radiologic outcome, although this relationship may not be independent of the effect of the SE. However, interaction between MnSOD and GST genes appears to influence radiologic outcome independently of the SE. The P19 embryonal carcinoma-derived cell line consists of undifferentiated multipotential cells, which irreversibly differentiate into mature neurons after exposure to retinoic acid (RA). In the present study, the authors genetically engineered P19 cells to produce glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and grafted the cells in a rat model that had been rendered parkinsonian. Undifferentiated P19 cells were grown in vitro and transduced with GDNF complementary DNA. The level of GDNF released from the transduced cells was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and its neurotrophic activities were assessed by testing the effects on rat embryonic dopamine (DA) neurons in culture. After having been exposed to RA for 48 hours and allowed to differentiate into postmitotic neurons, the GDNF gene-transduced cells were implanted into the midbrain of immunosuppressed rats. A unilateral nigrostriatal lesion was then induced by intrastriatal infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine. Immunohistochemical analyses performed 4 weeks postgrafting revealed that the GDNF-producing cells expressed several neuronal markers without evidence of overgrowth. The grafts expressed GDNF protein and prevented the death of nigral DA neurons. Furthermore, the GDNF-producing cells implanted 4 weeks after nigrostriatal lesions restored the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in injured DA neurons and induced their dendritic sprouting. The results indicate that the P19 cell line transduced with the GDNF gene can stably secrete functional levels of GDNF, even after being converted to postmitotic neurons. Because it is has been established that GDNF exerts trophic effects on DA neurons, the means currently used to deliver GDNF into the brain could be a viable strategy to prevent the death of nigral DA neurons in cases of Parkinson's disease. The primary and secondary sexual characteristics of many species of passerine birds undergo dramatic seasonal variation in response to the change in the length of photoperiod. Among the many physiological processes that undergo seasonal changes, bird song and the song control system underlying it undergo similar seasonal variation in size and function. The mechanisms of this seasonal variation are largely unknown but are at least partially due to steroidal action from the gonads. The present study determined the relative roles played by the gonads and the photoperiodic timing system that controls gonadal development on song control nuclei in the brain of the male house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Sparrows maintained in short photoperiods (SD) possessed small regressed testes. Transfer to long photoperiods (LD) for 6 weeks evoked a dramatic increase in testes size, but, after 20 weeks under the same conditions (LDLD), testes completely collapsed. Song control nuclei HVC and RA were smaller in SD than in LD but regressed only moderately in LDLD. Castration of sparrows in SD reduced the amplitude of the seasonal variation but did not completely abolish it. The data support the view that the song control system of the house sparrow is regulated by the photoperiodic timing system independently of gonadal influence, but that the gonads augment seasonal regulation of song, presumably via steroidal hormone secretion. The WT1 gene, which is heterozygously mutated or deleted in congenital anomaly syndromes and homozygously mutated in about 15% of all Wilms tumors, encodes tissue-specific developmental regulators. Through alternative mRNA splicing, four main WT1 protein isoforms are synthesized. All isoforms can bind to DNA via their zinc fingers, albeit with different affinities and specificities, and thereby modulate the transcriptional activity of their target genes. Several proteins bind to and alter the transcription regulatory properties of the WT1 proteins, including the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Interaction between WT1 and p53 was shown to modulate their ability to regulate the transcription of their respective target genes. Here, we report that all four isoforms of WT1 bind to p73, a recently cloned homologue of p53. p73 binds to the zinc finger region of WT1 and thereby inhibits DNA binding and transcription activation by WT1. Similarly, WT1 inhibits p73-induced transcription activation in reporter assays and counteracts p73-induced expression of endogenous Mdm2. This, taken together with our finding that WT1 also interacts with p63/KET, another p53 homologue, suggests that association between WT1 and the members of the p53 family of proteins may be an important determinant of their functions in cell growth and differentiation. A non-invasive urine analysis method to determine the in-vivo flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (FMO) activity catalysing N-oxidation of ranitidine (RA) was developed and used to phenotype a Korean population. FMO activity was assessed by the molar concentration ratio of RA and RANO in the bulked 8 h urine. This method was used to determine the FMO phenotypes of 210 Korean volunteers (173 men and 37 women, 110 nonsmokers and 100 smokers). Urinary RA/RANO ratio, representing the metabolic ratio and the reciprocal index of FMO activity, ranged from 5.67-27.20 (4.8-fold difference) and was not different between men and women (P = 0.76) or between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.50). The frequencies of RA/RANO ratios were distributed in a trimodal fashion. Among the 210 Korean subjects, 93 (44.3%) were fast metabolizers, 104 (49.5%) were intermediate metabolizers and 13 (6.2%) were slow metabolizers. Subsequently, the relationship between the ranitidine N-oxidation phenotypes and FMO3 genotypes, determined by the presence of two previously identified mutant alleles (Glu158Lys: FMO3/Lys158 and Glu308Gly: FMO3/Gly308 alleles) commonly found in our Korean population was examined. The results showed that subjects who were homozygous and heterozygous for either one or both of the FMO3/Lys158 and FMO3/Gly308 mutant alleles had significantly lower in-vivo FMO activities than those with homozygous wild-type alleles (FMO3/Glu158 and FMO3/Glu308) (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Furthermore, the FMO activities of subjects with either FMO3/Lys158 or FMO3/Gly308 mutant alleles were almost identical to those having both FMO3 mutant alleles (FMO3/Lys158 and FMO3/Gly308). These two mutant alleles located, respectively, at exons 4 and 7 in the FMO3 gene appeared to be strongly linked by cis-configuration in Koreans. Therefore, we concluded that presence of FMO3/Lys158 and FMO3/Gly308 mutant alleles in FMO3 gene is responsible for the low ranitidine N-oxidation (FMO3 activity) in our Korean population. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) regulates epithelial differentiation and growth through activation of specific nuclear RA receptors (RARs). Because high-rate metabolism largely impairs the biological efficacy of RA, we have sought for compounds capable of inhibiting the metabolic breakdown of the retinoid. This study identifies R115866 as a novel inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism of RA. In vitro, nanomolar concentrations of R115866 inhibited the conversion of RA by CYP26, a RA-inducible RA metabolizing enzyme. In vivo, oral administration of R115866 (2.5 mg/kg) to rats induced marked and transient increases of endogenous RA levels in plasma, skin, fat, kidney, and testis. Consistent with its ability to enhance endogenous RA content in tissues, R115866 was found to exert retinoidal activities. Like RA, the title compound: 1) inhibited vaginal keratinization in estrogen-stimulated rats; 2) induced epidermal hyperplasia in mouse ear skin; 3) transformed mouse tail epidermis from a para- to an orthokeratotic skin type; and 4) up-regulated the CYP26 mRNA expression in rat liver. Furthermore, we found that the keratinization-suppressive and CYP26-inducing activities of R115866 could be reversed by concomitant administration of the RAR antagonist, AGN193109. Our data characterize R115866 as a potent, orally active inhibitor of RA metabolism, capable of enhancing RA levels and displaying retinoidal actions. These activities are reversed by RAR antagonism, supporting the idea that the actions of R115866 result from increased availability of endogenous RA and improved RAR triggering. Based on experimental and epidemiological evidence it is hypothesized that estrogen increases breast cancer risk by increasing mitotic activity in breast epithelial cells. Aromatase is crucial to the biosynthesis of estrogens and may therefore play a role in breast cancer development. Supporting data for an etiological role of aromatase in breast tumor biology are several-fold. First, the association between weight and postmenopausal breast cancer risk may be mediated by aromatase. Secondly, a pilot study found a higher aromatase expression in normal breast adipose tissue from breast cancer cases as opposed to healthy women. Thirdly, experimental data in animals suggest that aromatase activity predisposes mammary tissue to preneoplastic and neoplastic changes. In a multiethnic cohort study conducted in Los Angeles and on Hawaii we investigated (i) whether the plasma estrone to androstenedione (E1/A) ratio in different ethnic groups was associated with ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence, and (ii) whether genetic variation in the CYP19 gene encoding the P450 aromatase protein was associated with breast cancer risk. The age- and weight-adjusted ethnic specific E1/A ratios x 100 among women without oophorectomy were 7.92 in African-Americans, 8.22 in Japanese, 10.73 in Latinas and 9.29 in non-Latina Whites (P=0.09). The high E1/A ratio in Latina women was not associated with a high breast cancer incidence; in fact Latina women had the lowest breast cancer incidence in the cohort observed so far. We found no consistent association of an intronic (TTTA)n repeat polymorphism with breast cancer risk in different ethnic groups. This polymorphism was not associated with differences in the plasma E1/A ratio in a way that would predict its functional relevance. We describe a newly identified TTC deletion in intron 5 of the CYP19 gene that is associated with the (TTTA)n repeat polymorphism. Neither this polymorphism, nor a polymorphism at codon 264 in exon VII of the CYP19 gene, was associated with breast cancer. We did not identify any genetic variation in exon VIII in 54 African-American subjects. We identified rare genetic variants of unknown functional relevance in the promoter 1.4 of the CYP19 gene in 3 out of 24 Latina women. Further investigation into the role of aromatase in breast cancer etiology is important, given that the potential use of aromatase inhibitors as breast cancer chemopreventives depends on these results. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to regulate multiple aspects of brain development and neural plasticity in vertebrates. We have examined BDNF expression in two telencephalic nuclei (RA and HVC) in the zebra finch brain that control song learning by juvenile males and the production of already-learned song by adults. Using two different antibody-labeling techniques (avidin-biotin complex and horseradish peroxidase), we were unable to detect BDNF-like immunoreactivity in RA of juvenile or adult birds. BDNF-like immunoreactive labeling of somata was detected in HVC, but the density of labeled cells was not different between juvenile and adult birds. Immunocytochemical findings were confirmed by RT-PCR for BDNF mRNA. Thus, in contrast to a previous report (Akutagawa and Konishi, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) 11429-11434), we did not observe elevated levels of BDNF immunoreactivity in RA and HVC of juvenile birds that were learning to sing. However, RA and HVC of juvenile birds were found to express elevated levels of endogenous biotin (as detected by avidin peroxidase), suggesting a possible role for biotin-regulated mechanisms in songbird vocal learning. CYP26 (P450RAI) catalyzes catabolic retinoic acid (RA) hydroxylation and thereby appears to play a critical role in retinoid signaling pathways during development. In this study, a quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for evaluation of CYP26 message levels in human prenatal tissues. Statistical analyses of transcription levels in 12 prenatal human brains and six prenatal human livers demonstrated good sensitivity and reproducibility. Quantitative profiles of CYP26 gene expression in early (gestational days 57-110) prenatal cephalic and hepatic tissues and comparisons with adult counterparts are reported for the first time. Prenatal cephalic tissues at days 57-67 exhibited values of 1950+/-420 (CYP26 molecules/10(6) GAPDH molecules) whereas prenatal cephalic tissues at days 105-110 exhibited values of 22300+/-4450 (CYP26 molecules/10(6) GAPDH molecules), indicating a sharp developmental increase (approximately 11-fold). Levels in human adult cephalic tissues were slightly less than the prenatal cephalic levels measured during the earliest stages of gestation and were approximately 3-fold lower than those measured in adult human hepatic tissues. Levels in human prenatal hepatic tissues at days 63-110 gestation were less than 800 (CYP26 molecules/10(6) GAPDH molecules) and did not exhibit developmental increases. Considered together, the data have strong implications for the importance of CYP26 in early development of the human brain. Synovial fluids (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), gout, and osteoarthritis (OA) were investigated for the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8, tryptophan (Trp) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity. Significant differences exist in the levels of IL-1 beta between inflammatory arthritides RA, PsA and gout and non inflammatory arthritis, such as OA. The highest concentration of IL-1 beta was found in RA, that showed high levels also of IL-6 and IL-8. In the same disease we also found the highest IDO activity and the lowest Trp concentration. In addition, IDO activity seems to be related with the decrease in Trp, as demonstrated by the inverse correlation found between these two substances in the SF of all patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and localization of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) in synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synovial tissues from 9 patients with RA and 5 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were examined for COX-1 and COX-2 expressions by immunohistochemical staining using 2 polydonal COX-1 and COX-2 antibodies. In RA synovia, synovial lining cells showed intense immunostaining for COX-1, whereas slight to moderate staining was observed in inflammatory cells, stromal fibroblast-like cells and vascular endothelial cells. There was no significant difference in COX-1 expression between RA and OA synovia. The localization of COX-2 expression dearly differed from that of COX-1 expression, being most intense in inflammatory cells. However, there was no difference in COX-1 and COX-2 expressions between RA and OA synovial tissues. Our observations support that inflammatory mechanisms modulated by COX-1 and COX-2 in chronic RA synovium might be similar to those in chronic OA synovium. Endogenous patterns of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in avian cardiac morphogenesis were characterized by localized expression of a key RA-synthetic enzyme, RALDH2, which displayed a biphasic pattern during heart development. RALDH2 immunoreactivity was initially apparent posterior to Hensen's node of stage 5-6 embryos and subsequently in somites and unsegmented paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm overlapping atrial precursors in the cardiogenic plate of stage 9- embryos. Initial RALDH2 synthesis in the posterior myocardium coincided with activation of the AMHC1 gene, a RA-responsive marker of inflow heart segments. A wave of RALDH2 synthesis then swept the myocardium in a posterior-to-anterior direction, reaching the outflow tract by stage 13, then fading from the myocardial layer. The second phase of RALDH2 expression, initiated at stage 18 in the proepicardial organ, persisted in migratory epicardial cells that completely enveloped the heart by stage 24. Early restriction of RALDH2 expression to the posterior cardiogenic plate, overlapping RA-inducible gene activation, provides evidence for commitment of posterior avian heart segments by localized production of RA, whereas subsequent RALDH2 expression exclusively in the migratory epicardium suggests a role for the morphogen in ventricular expansion and morphogenesis of underlying myocardial tissues. Besides its role in ocular development, retinoic acid (RA), which is a light-correlated byproduct of the phototransduction cycle, was recently shown to affect light-driven synaptic plasticity in the outer plexiform layer of the adult fish retina. Tuning by ambient light conditions of the retinal network properties is very prominent in outer plexiform layer circuits, and we therefore examined whether RA could affect cone horizontal cell physiology similar to ambient light. Performing intracellular recordings and dye injections in the dark-adapted inverted eyecup preparation of the carp, we found that RA reduced the receptive fields of horizontal cell somata and impaired gap junctional communication. This action was not observed among coupled axon terminals of horizontal cells and appeared to be stereospecific because it could only be attributed to all-trans and 13-cis RA but not to the 9-cis isomer and photoisomerized all-trans RA. Modulation of receptive field size occurred independently of the dopaminergic system. Furthermore, RA affected the light responsiveness of cone horizontal cells. Compared to the dark-adapted condition, responsiveness to intense light stimulation was enhanced but decreased when low intensities were used. Moreover, following RA treatment H2-type horizontal cells of dark-adapted retinae which do not give rise to colour-opponent light properties became colour-opponent and performed depolarizing responses to long-wavelength stimulation. In all these cases RA perfectly matched the effects of light adaptation, supporting the notion that RA acts as an endogenous neuromodulator. Interactions between all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) affect the expression of neurotrophin receptors in sympathetic neurons (Kobayashi et al., 1998). In this study, we examined the possibility that similar interactions might regulate the morphological development of these neurons. Under control conditions, embryonic rat sympathetic neurons formed axons but not dendrites; cells exposed to RA had a similar appearance. Profuse dendritic growth was observed upon exposure to BMP-7, and this was reduced by approximately 70% by RA. This inhibitory effect of RA was mediated primarily by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and it exhibited substantial specificity because it was not associated with changes in either axonal elongation or cell survival. Moreover, mRNAs for enzymes required for synthesis of RA were expressed in the sympathetic neurons and retinoid activity was released from superior cervical ganglia. These observations suggest that retinoids may function as endogenous morphogens and regulate neural cell shape and polarity in developing sympathetic ganglia. Although NO has been postulated to play important roles in host defences, it is potentially damaging for exposed cells, including for the macrophages producing the NO. Thus a network of radical acceptors and enzymes is thought to play an important redox-buffering role to protect cells against NO-mediated injury. We examined the properties of the redox systems superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase, glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx), in regulating the viability of two human monocytic cell lines (THP1 and U937) exposed to the NO-generating compound diethylene triamine-nitric oxide (DETA-NO). We observed that NO-induced cytotoxic effects were time- and dose-dependent towards the two cell lines. After vitamin-induced differentiation in vitro with retinoic acid (RA) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D(3) (VD), termed RA/VD, we observed that THP1 RA/VD cells became more resistant to NO-mediated cytotoxicity whereas the susceptibility of U937 cells was not modified. Using Western blotting and reverse-transcriptase PCR methods, we observed that gene transcription and protein expression of Trx and thioredoxin reductase were significantly increased upon RA/VD treatment and differentiation in THP1 cells. By contrast, SOD/catalase and GSH redox state remained unmodified. Finally, a stable transfectant THP1 line overexpressing Trx was found to be more resistant than THP1 control cells that were untransfected or transfected with an empty plasmid, when exposed to DETA-NO in vitro. In conclusion, we observed an inverse correlation between cell susceptibility to NO damaging effects and Trx expression, suggesting that the Trx system may have important preventative capacities towards NO-mediated cellular injury in monocytic macrophage cells. A-type lamins are not present in either early embryos or the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line. P19 cells, which are EC cell line, are able to express A-type lamins upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Here we report that a novel RA-responsive element, termed lamin A/C-RA-responsive element (L-RARE), is located within the lamin A/C promoter. RA activated the luciferase activity of the reporter which had four tandem repeats of the wild-type L-RARE, while a loss of function mutant, which altered CACCCCC to CACtatC within L-RARE, did not respond. Four specific binding complexes of L-RARE, Complexes-A, -B, -C, and -D, were detected in protein extracts obtained from P19 cells treated with and without RA. Specific antibodies revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 were included in Complex-A and Complexes-B and -C, respectively. Thus, L-RARE was important in the RA-mediated activation of the lamin A/C promoter and was recognized by DNA binding proteins. New pharmacologic treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are described. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed for RA but are limited by the risk of adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. The therapeutic effects of these agents are mediated primarily through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and prevention of subsequent formation of prostaglandins and related inflammatory mediators. Nonspecific COX inhibition appears to be responsible for much of the toxicity of NSAIDs. Agents have been developed that can selectively inhibit the COX-2 isoform, while sparing COX-1. Celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors appear to be no more efficacious than conventional NSAIDs, but offer superior safety. COX-2 inhibitors should be considered for patients who are candidates for NSAID therapy but at risk for GI bleeding. Unlike disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), these agents do not alter underlying disease progression. Leflunomide is a newer DMARD that reduces pyrimidine synthesis, thus decreasing rheumatoid inflammation. Leflunomide appears to be as effective as methotrexate but, unlike that drug, does not necessitate monitoring for bone marrow toxicity. Etanercept, the first biological agent with FDA-approved labeling for use in RA, has shown efficacy and minimal toxicity, except for injection-site reactions. Other biologicals that have been investigated for use in RA include infliximab and interleukin-1-receptor antagonist. COX-2 inhibitors, leflunomide, and etanercept are promising new drugs available for treating RA. Other agents are under development. The fusion protein PML/RARA, associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia behaves as an abnormal retinoic acid (RA) receptor with altered transactivation properties but is still inducible by RA. The chimeric protein is thought to promote leukemogenesis but also paradoxically to mediate the sensitivity to ATRA of APL cells. This has been supported by works reporting that in vitro ATRA resistance is characterized by defects in the RARA/E-domain of PML/RARA. In the present report, we identified a new mutation in the E domain of PML/RARA which is associated with a RA-resistant subline of NB4 cells; NB4-R2. This mutation, identical to the Gln411 mutation found in HL60-R, changes the amino acid Gln903 to an in-phase stop codon, generating a truncated form of PML/RARA which has lost 52 amino acids at its C-terminal end. We have studied the effect of the truncated PML/RARA protein on PML NB formation and RARA and PML/RARA transcriptional activity. We show here that the fusion mutant exerts a dominant negative effect on wild-type PML, PML/RARA and RARA transcription activity. These findings highlight the important role of the RARA E-domain of PML/RARA in mediating RA sensitivity in APL cells. Clinical use of nitric oxide (NO) is usually in conjunction with high oxygen concentrations, the effects of which may include lung neutrophil accumulation, apoptosis and upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. To define the effects of NO on neutrophils from young piglets and its relationship to lung neutrophil dynamics during hyperoxia we exposed thirty piglets to room air (RA), RA+NO (50 ppm NO), O2 (FiO2> or =0.96) or O2+NO for 5 days. Ten additional animals breathed RA+NO or O2+NO, then recovered in RA for 3 days before sacrifice. Neutrophil CD18 and intracellular oxidant production were measured by flow cytometry. Lung apoptosis were assessed by TUNEL assay. Lung myeloperoxidase, SOD and catalase were measured biochemically. When compared to RA group, there was significant reduction in neutrophil CD18 and intracellular oxidant production in the RA+NO group, but lung MPO was unchanged. The O2 and O2+NO groups did not differ in CD18 expression or in intracellular oxidant production, but had significant increase in lung myeloperoxidase compared to the RA group. Apoptosis increased significantly only in the O2+NO group. The O2 group showed significantly increased lung SOD and catalase activity compared to the RA group, whereas the RA+NO and O2+NO groups did not. We conclude that inhaled NO at 50 ppm decreases neutrophil CD18 expression as well as intracellular oxidant production. However, this effect does not impact lung neutrophil accumulation during concurrent hyperoxia. The combination of NO and O2 exposure produces an increase in lung apoptosis. Finally, NO may prevent upregulation of SOD and catalase activity during hyperoxia, potentially increasing injury. Targeted disruption of the murine retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) gene precludes embryonic retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, leading to midgestational lethality (Niederreither, K., Subbarayan, V., Dolle, P. and Chambon, P. (1999). Nature Genet. 21, 444-448). We describe here the effects of this RA deficiency on the development of the hindbrain and associated neural crest. Morphological segmentation is impaired throughout the hindbrain of Raldh2-/- embryos, but its caudal portion becomes preferentially reduced in size during development. Specification of the midbrain region and of the rostralmost rhombomeres is apparently normal in the absence of RA synthesis. In contrast, marked alterations are seen throughout the caudal hindbrain of mutant embryos. Instead of being expressed in two alternate rhombomeres (r3 and r5), Krox20 is expressed in a single broad domain, correlating with an abnormal expansion of the r2-r3 marker Meis2. Instead of forming a defined r4, Hoxb1- and Wnt8A-expressing cells are scattered throughout the caudal hindbrain, whereas r5/r8 markers such as kreisler or group 3/4 Hox genes are undetectable or markedly downregulated. Lack of alternate Eph receptor gene expression could explain the failure to establish rhombomere boundaries. Increased apoptosis and altered migratory pathways of the posterior rhombencephalic neural crest cells are associated with impaired branchial arch morphogenesis in mutant embryos. We conclude that RA produced by the embryo is required to generate posterior cell fates in the developing mouse hindbrain, its absence leading to an abnormal r3 (and, to a lesser extent, r4) identity of the caudal hindbrain cells. Eye growth is visually regulated via messengers that are released from the retina. The retina involves a yet unknown algorithm to analyse the projected image so that the appropriate growth rates for the back of the eye are ensured. One biochemical candidate that could act as a growth controller, is retinoic acid (RA). Previous work (Seko, Shimokawa and Tokoro, 1996; Mertz et al., 1999) has shown that retinal and choroidal RA levels are indeed predictably changed by visual conditions that cause myopia or hyperopia, respectively. We have studied in which fundal tissues aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (AHD2) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (RALDH2), enzymes involved in RA synthesis, are expressed and at which levels the effects of vision on RA levels may be controlled. Using Northern blot analysis, we have found that the retinal mRNA level of the AHD2 is up-regulated after 3 days of treatment with negative lenses (negative lenses place the image behind the retina). The abundance of the retinal mRNA of a RA receptor, RAR-beta, was up-regulated already after 6 hr of treatment with positive lenses (positive lenses place the image in front of the retina). The up-regulation persisted for at least 1 week. Finally, we have studied the effects of an inhibitor of RA synthesis, disulfiram, on the visual control of eye growth. We found inhibition of myopia as induced by frosted goggles ('deprivation myopia') but no significant inhibitory effects on refractive errors induced by +7D or -7D lenses. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that RA may play a role in the visual control of eye growth. The RA system differs from a number of other candidates (dopamine, cholinergic agents, opiates) in that it distinguishes between positive and negative defocus, similar to the immediate early gene ZENK (Stell et al., 1999). The exact time kinetics of the changes have still to be worked out since it is possible that the changes in RA relate to already occurring changes in growth rather than to initial steps of the signaling cascade. Strong evidence exists for the masculinizing effects of estrogen on the neural network that controls song learning and behavior in zebra finches. However, the mechanisms by which estrogen acts to influence the development of this circuitry are not well understood. In this study, we used in situ hybridization to detect the distribution of cells expressing mRNAs for AROM and ERalpha at postnatal days 5-25 (P5-25). Our findings revealed developmental regulation of both mRNAs in the neostriatum, archistriatum, hippocampus, diencephalon and midbrain. Within the vocal control circuitry, cells expressing ERalpha mRNA were found in the medial HVC (P10-25), archistriatum lateral to the RA (Ad; P25), in the ICo (P5-25), and along the fiber tract containing efferents from the RA. High levels of AROM mRNA were found in the neostriatum, including both the lateral and mMAN and along their projections to the RA and HVC, respectively, (P5-25), in the archistriatum (P18-25) and around RA (P18). Codistribution of the two mRNAs occurred along the border of the HVC suggesting that in this region, local synthesis of estrogen may be acting through its nuclear receptor to regulate gene transcription. Taken together, our findings show that the neural circuitry controlling song may be exposed to the effects of estrogen during early postnatal development. However, in most of the song control regions, these mRNAs were not expressed together either temporally or spatially, indicating that AROM may have a role in the development of the song system independent of ERalpha. This article confirms the susceptibility of osteoblastic cells to adenoviral transduction. Osteoblasts were harvested from human cancellous bone. Cells were transduced, using various amounts of adenoviral vectors carrying the cDNA encoding interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra), or the marker genes beta-galactosidase and luciferase. Expression of the transgenes and the biological activity of IL-1 Ra produced by gene transfer were measured quantitatively in a time-course by ELISA. The rate of transduction was 100% after exposure to 1 x 10(7) infective particles of adeno-LacZ. No expression of IL-1Ra was seen after transduction with adeno-IL-1Ra at titers of 1 x 10(4) and less. However, after transduction at titers of 1 x 10(7), infective particles cells expressed IL-1 Ra consistently for 72 days, with levels up to 1 microg IL-1 Ra/1 x 10(6) cells/ 48 hours. None of the control samples expressed detectable levels of IL-1 Ra. The biological activity of the transgenic IL-1 Ra was demonstrated by its ability to suppress successfully IL-1-induced nitric oxide synthesis by rabbit articular chondrocytes. After transduction with 1 x 10(7) infective particles of the adenoluciferase vector, up to 81,000 Units transgenic luciferase/x 10(6) osteoblastic cells were measured 2 days after gene transfer. Our results show that adenovirus transduces osteoblastic cells at a high rate in vitro. We present here a case of MPO-ANCA positive rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) after 34 months of D-penicillamine (D-PC) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A 27-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed as having RA in June 1994 at our out-patient clinic. Oral D-PC administration was initiated at a dose of 100 mg per day in January 1995. In August 1997, proteinuria, hematuria, renal insufficiency, and anemia developed. D-PC was withdrawn promptly, and prednisolone 5 mg per day was started. The patient was admitted to our hospital in September. On admission, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody against mycloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) was strongly positive in the serum. Renal biopsy showed glomerulonephritis with cellular crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli observed. Immunofluorescence examinations revealed deposits of granular IgG, IgA, C 1 q, and C 3 in the mesangium. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy along with administration of anti-coagulation and anti-platelet agents under the diagnosis of MPO-ANCA positive D-PC-induced RPGN. The renal function was gradually recovered and MPO-ANCA disappeared. Since RPGN is potentially a fatal disease, frequent monitoring of renal function and discontinuation of D-PC are required. In case MPO-ANCA becomes positive, prompt and correct diagnosis of the renal disorder could lead to a good prognosis as in this case. The present case may provide some important immunological insights into medical procedures to treat D-PC-induced RPGN and MPO-ANCA related glomerulonephritis. To examine the localization and distribution of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which participate in nitric oxide (NO) production, in synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Immunohistochemical analysis for eNOS and iNOS in synovial tissues obtained from 10 patients with RA who were underwent total knee replacement. Synovial tissues of osteoarthritis (OA) were used as control. The percentage of cells that were positive for eNOS and iNOS was estimated in five hundred endothelial cells, synovial lining cells and interstitial cells, respectively. And mRNA expression of NOS was confirmed by in situ hybridization. In addition, to test NO production, nitration of tyrosines was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Not only endothelial cells but also synovial lining cells and interstitial cells exhibited immune-reactive both eNOS and iNOS. Cells which were seemed immune-reactive eNOS and iNOS expressed nitrotyrosin. By in situ hybridization, we detected mRNA expression for eNOS and iNOS. Endothelial cells, synovial lining cells and interstitial cells expressed both eNOS and iNOS with high frequency in RA synovium compared with OA synovium. It seemed to correlate with NO production. These results suggest that expression of iNOS may be involved in the induction of arthritis and eNOS may be participated in augmentation of inflammation in RA. The etiologic role of sex hormones in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been discussed. Cytochrome P450c 17 alpha (CYP17) regulates steroidogenesis and the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the CYP17 gene are related to serum sex hormone production. In this study, the relationship between CYP17 gene RFLPs and RA was investigated. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 91 male and 285 female patients with RA, as well as from 380 male and 579 female controls, and the RFLPs of the CYP17 gene (denoted as the A1 and A2 alleles) were determined. Clinical variables were recorded for the RA patients. There were no significant differences in CYP17 genotype distribution between the male RA patients and male controls, nor between the female RA patients and female controls. RA patients with the A2 allele tended to develop the disease at a younger age than those without (in men 50.1 vs 54.7 yrs, p = 0.15; in women 43.9 vs 47.4 yrs, p = 0.038). In women, having the A2 allele was a weak protective factor against developing RA at an older age (odds ratio: 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.95, p = 0.026). The RFLPs of the CYP17 gene may constitute a disease modifying factor through sex hormone production. To determine the effects of celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) on the renal clearance and plasma pharmacokinetic profile of stable methotrexate (MTX) doses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fourteen adult female patients with RA taking a stable weekly dose of MTX (5 to 15 mg/wk) for a minimum of 3 months were randomized to receive concomitantly either celecoxib (200 mg BID) or placebo for a period of 7 days in a single blind, 2 period crossover study of MTX pharmacokinetics and renal clearance. The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of MTX did not change significantly when celecoxib or a placebo was coadministered. The mean renal clearance of MTX alone, 7.98+/-2.18 l/h, was virtually unchanged by coadministration of celecoxib (7.94+/-1.61 l/h) or placebo (7.97+/-1.19 l/h). Celecoxib has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or renal clearance of MTX in patients with RA, although these results should be confirmed in prospective studies of elderly and renally impaired patients. NSAIDs/Corticosteroids are the most used and maybe misused drugs against "aches and pains of the musculoskeletal system". Their effectiveness to reduce (not cure) inflammation and related pain is without doubt. The problem is that of their side effects in particular of the GI-tract and other body systems. It is clear that these side effects occur more often and more seriously in a number of patients, the so-called high risk group: elderly women, patients with previous history of gastro-intestinal ulcer and corticosteroid users. The discovery that there are two pathways to influence cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin production and that some NSAIDs have a more marked COX-2 and COX-1 inhibition opens new perspectives. COX-1 is present in normal tissues and is responsible for the production of protective prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa and other tissues. COX-2 is induced by inflammatory cytokines and plays a role in the inflammatory cascade. Therefore more specific COX-2 antagonists should be safer for the gastro-intestinal mucosa and kidney function. The risk of hip fracture is 50% higher in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, and 30-35% of corticosteroid patients have vertebral fractures. The renewed interest in osteoporosis and increased number of papers on bone loss in RA reflect on the one hand the advances in technology to measure bone mineral density (BMD) accurately and precisely, and on the other hand the availability of effective drugs to stop bone loss and reverse the process. The possible deleterious effect of low dose corticosteroids continues to be a subject of concern, particularly in rheumatology where serum levels of free cortisone may be higher because of low albumen and other protein changes. Recently, several editorials and conflicting data obtained from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in RA on steroid-induced osteoporosis have been published. Because the pathogenesis of steroid osteoporosis is distinct from that of entities such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, each therapy requires specific assessment in steroid treated patients. In recent years a wide variety of therapies, for example hormone replacement therapy, calcium supplements administered with vitamin D metabolites, thiazides, diuretics, anabolic steroids, tibolone, calcitonin and bisphosphonates, have been proposed to prevent osteoporosis in patients receiving longterm corticosteroid therapy, but there have been few carefully controlled trials, except for vitamin D and bisphosphonates. Excess retinoids as well as retinoid deprivation cause abnormal development, suggesting that retinoid homeostasis is critical for proper morphogenesis. RALDH-2 and CYP26, two key enzymes that carry out retinoic acid (RA) synthesis and degradation, respectively, were cloned from the chick and show significant homology with their orthologs in other vertebrates. Expression patterns of RALDH-2 and CYP26 genes were determined in the early chick embryo by in situ hybridization. During gastrulation and neurulation RALDH-2 and CYP26 were expressed in nonoverlapping regions, with RALDH-2 transcripts localized to the presumptive presomitic and lateral plate mesoderm and CYP26 mRNA to the presumptive mid- and forebrain. The two domains of expression were separated by an approximately 300-micrometer-wide gap, encompassing the presumptive hindbrain. In the limb region, a similar spatial segregation of RALDH-2 and CYP26 expression was found at stages 14 and 15. Limb region mesoderm expressed RALDH-2, whereas the overlying limb ectoderm expressed CYP26. RA-synthesizing and -degrading enzymatic activities were measured biochemically in regions expressing RALDH-2 or CYP26. Regions expressing RALDH-2 generated RA efficiently from precursor retinal but degraded RA only inefficiently. Conversely, tissue expressing CYP26 efficiently degraded but did not synthesize RA. Localized regions of RA synthesis and degradation mediated by these two enzymes may therefore provide a mechanism to regulate RA homeostasis spatially in vertebrate embryos. Estimate the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by measuring the serum levels of the leucocyte-derived granular proteins: lysozyme, myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL). Serum levels of these granular proteins were measured in patients with RA (n=23) and in healthy controls (n=27), and in 10 patients with RA after treatment with low-dose prednisolone. The serum levels of the granular proteins were also measured before and after treatment with metyrapone, a substance that inhibits the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenals. The serum levels of lysozyme and MPO were elevated in patients with RA, while the concentrations of lactoferrin and HNL were similar in both groups. Prednisolone treatment decreased the serum concentration of lysozyme and MPO. Metyrapone did not influence the level of the granular proteins measured. The increased serum levels of lysozyme and MPO, but not of HNL and lactoferrin in RA could indicate a stimulated secretory activity of mononuclear phagocytes. The measurement of serum lysozyme, as an indicator of monocyte/macrophage activity, might be used to study disease activity in RA. Retinoids, and their synthetic analogues, are well-established regulators of the squamous differentiation programme both in vivo and in vitro. Despite this, very few studies have focused on the mechanism by which retinoid action is terminated, e.g. metabolism. Recently, a new cytochrome P450 family member (CYP26AI) was cloned. CYP26AI was reported to have substrate specificity for retinoids and to be retinoid-inducible. In this study, we have examined the expression and retinoic acid (RA) inducibility of CYP26AI in human epidermis and cultured keratinocytes. We found very low levels of CYP26AI mRNA expression in both epidermis and keratinocytes. Furthermore, we found no evidence for RA inducibility of CYP26 mRNA expression. This lack of RA inducibility was not due to inactivity of the retinoids, as we show that transglutaminase was still repressed by RA in the same cultures. Despite the low levels of CYP26AI expression in the keratinocytes, the keratinocytes were still capable of significant RA metabolism. In conclusion, our study reports, for the first time, that CYP26AI is unlikely to contribute to RA metabolism in keratinocytes. These studies also indicate that as yet unknown isoforms of cytochrome P450 may be involved in RA metabolism in keratinocytes. During vertebrate embryogenesis retinoic acid (RA) synthesis must be spatiotemporally regulated in order to appropriately stimulate various retinoid signaling pathways. Various forms of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) have been shown to oxidize the vitamin A precursor retinal to RA in vitro. Here we show that injection of Xenopus embryos with mRNAs for either mouse Aldh1 or mouse Raldh2 stimulates RA synthesis at low and high levels, respectively, while injection of human ALDH3 mRNA is unable to stimulate any detectable level of RA synthesis. This provides evidence that some members of the ALDH gene family can indeed perform RA synthesis in vivo. Whole-mount immunohistochemical analyses of mouse embryos indicate that ALDH1 and RALDH2 proteins are localized in distinct tissues. RALDH2 is detected at E7.5-E10.5 primarily in trunk tissue (paraxial mesoderm, somites, pericardium, midgut, mesonephros) plus transiently from E8.5-E9.5 in the ventral optic vesicle and surrounding frontonasal region. ALDH1 is first detected at E9.0-E10. 5 primarily in cranial tissues (ventral mesencephalon, dorsal retina, thymic primordia, otic vesicles) and in the mesonephros. As previous findings indicate that embryonic RA is more abundant in trunk rather than cranial tissues, our findings suggest that Raldh2 and Aldh1 control distinct retinoid signaling pathways by stimulating high and low RA biosynthetic activities, respectively, in various trunk and cranial tissues. We have mutated the type I cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP-I), individually at the Arg131 (into Ala) and the Tyr133 (into Phe) residues which have been predicted to make direct contact with retinoic acid (RA) based upon previous structural studies. The RA-binding affinities of these mutants are examined and their biological effects on RA induction of reporter genes are determined. The R131A mutation drastically affects its ligand-binding property, but the Y133F mutation has little effect. By using an RA-inducible reporter, it is found that the wild type CRABP-I exerts biphasic effects on RA induction of the reporter. The early (at 12 h) effect is to enhance RA induction, whereas the delayed (at 24 h) effect is to suppress RA induction. In consistence with their RA binding property, the R131A mutant loses both its early and delayed biological activities, whereas the Y133F mutant remains as effective as the wild type. It is concluded that CRABP-I over-expression exerts biphasic effects on RA-mediated gene expression, and that Arg131, but not Tyr133, is essential for a high RA-binding affinity of this protein as well as its biological activity. Paracellular permeability to solutes across the descending colon is much higher in cattle than sheep. This is a possible route for transmission of infective materials, such as scrapie prion. To compare the permeabilities of labelled scrapie prion protein and other macromolecules in bovine and ovine descending colons in vitro. Using fresh slaughterhouse material, transepithelial fluxes of macromolecules across colonic mucosae mounted in Ussing chambers were measured by monitoring transport of either enzyme activity or radioactivity. The comparative bovine to ovine permeability ratio of the probes increased with molecular weight: from 3.1 (0.13) for PEG400 to 10.67 (0.20) (p<0.001) for PEG4000; and from 1.64 (0.17) for microperoxidase to 7.03 (0.20) (p<0.001) for horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The permeability of (125)I-labelled inactivated Syrian hamster scrapie prion protein (ShaPrP(sc)) was 7.02 (0.33)-fold higher in bovine than ovine colon (p<0.0025). In each species, the probe permeabilities decreased according to the formula: P = P(o). exp(-K.ra). The "ideal" permeabilities, P(o) are similar, however, K((ovine)) = 2.46 (0.20) cm/h/nm exceeds K((bovine)) = 0.85 (0.15) cm/h/nm (p<0.001) indicating that bovine colon has a higher proportion of wide pores than ovine. Image analysis confirmed that HRP permeated through the bovine mucosal layer via a pericryptal paracellular route much more rapidly than in sheep. These data may imply that scrapie prion is transmitted in vivo more easily across the low resistance bovine colonic barrier than in other species. To examine the expression of the thioredoxin (TRX)-thioredoxin reductase (TR) system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with other rheumatic diseases. Levels of TRX in plasma and synovial fluid (SF) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cellular distribution of TRX was determined by flow cytometry and histochemistry. Cellular expression of TR was studied by in situ messenger RNA (mRNA) hybridization. The effect of oxidative stress and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) on TRX expression by cultured rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes was studied. Significantly increased TRX levels were found in the SF from 22 patients with RA, when compared with plasma levels in the same patients (P < 0.001) and compared with SF TRX levels in 15 patients with osteoarthritis (P < 0.001), 13 patients with gout (P < 0.05), and 9 patients with reactive arthritis (P < 0.0001). The presence of TRX could be demonstrated within the SF-derived mononuclear cells and synovial tissue (ST) of RA patients. Concordantly, expression of TR mRNA was observed in the ST of these patients. Stimulation of synovial fibroblast-like synoviocytes with either H2O2 or TNF alpha induced an increase in the production of TRX. The data demonstrate significantly increased concentrations of TRX in the SF and ST of RA patients when compared with the levels in patients with other joint diseases. Evidence is presented that the local environment in the rheumatic joint contributes to increased TRX production. Based on its growth-promoting and cytokine-like properties, it is proposed that increased expression of TRX contributes to the disease activity in RA. Several studies indicate that the size of body fat stores and the circulating levels of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin are able to influence the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The leptin-hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal interactions have been mainly studied at the level of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the possibility that leptin may have direct effects on the rodent Leydig cell function. To probe this hypothesis, we first analyzed the expression of leptin receptors (OB-R) in rodent Leydig cells in culture. RT-PCR studies showed that rat Leydig cells express both the long (OB-Rb) and short isoform (OB-Ra) of leptin receptor, whereas MLTC-1 cells (a murine Leydig tumor cell line) express only the long isoform. Short-term (30-90 min) incubation of rat Leydig cells with increasing concentrations ofleptin (2-500 ng/ml) led to a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of human (h)CG-stimulated testosterone (T) production (approximately 60% reduction, IC50 = 20 ng/ml) but no change in basal androgen release. Also, leptin (150 ng/ml) amplified hCG-induced intracellular cAMP formation (1- to 2-fold) without modifying basal cAMP levels. Subsequent experiments showed that leptin inhibited 8Br-cAMP-stimulated T production, indicating that leptin's effect is exerted beyond cAMP. The inhibitory effect of leptin on hCG-induced T secretion was accompanied by a significant reduction of androstenedione and a concomitant rise of the precursor metabolites pregnenolone, progesterone, and 17-OH-progesterone, conceivable with a leptin-induced lesion of 17,20 lyase activity. Separate experiments performed with the MLTC-1 cells (not expressing cytochrome P450-17alpha) showed that leptin, though amplifying hCG-stimulated cAMP production, did not modify hCG-stimulated pregnenolone and progesterone release. These results further indicate that leptin action on steroidogenesis occurs downstream of progesterone synthesis. Northern Blot experiments showed no acute effect of leptin on cytochrome P450-17alpha messenger RNA accumulation in rat Leydig cells in basal and hCG-stimulated conditions, excluding that the rapid changes observed were caused by messenger RNA degradation. In conclusion, these findings, for the first time, show that leptin has direct, receptor-mediated actions on rodent Leydig cells in culture, at concentrations within the range of obese men. To investigate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in subpopulations of peripheral blood and synovial fluid (SF) leukocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). iNOS was detected in peripheral blood and SF samples after cell permeabilization, by 2 color immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Samples from 14 patients with RA and 8 with osteoarthritis (OA) were studied. Nitrite concentration was determined by Griess reaction, interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha by an immunoenzymatic assay, and C-reactive protein (CRP) by an immunonephelometric method. In SF, iNOS was detected in 11 of 14 patients with RA and 2 of 8 with OA. In blood cells, iNOS was detected in 8 of 14 patients with RA and none of the OA group. iNOS was consistently detected in monocytes and was not detected in granular cells. In RA, there was no correlation between the number of iNOS positive mononuclear cells and cytokine concentrations. CRP concentration was correlated with the number of iNOS positive mononuclear cells in RA SF samples. SF mononuclear cells from patients with RA express iNOS and are involved in NO production in the joint. The number of positive cells is correlated with CRP concentration, suggesting the implication of NO production in the inflammatory process. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, despite their well-established association with gastroduodenal injury. Recent discovery of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes COX-1 and COX-2 has improved our knowledge of the action of NSAIDs. COX-1 is continuously expressed in almost all tissues, where it converts arachidonate to the prostaglandins (PGs) important in homeostatic function; COX-2 is present in immune cells, blood vessel endothelial cells, and synovial fibroblasts. Classic NSAIDs inhibit both COX isoenzymes by occupying the cyclooxygenase-active site, preventing access by arachidonic acid. In theory, a drug such as celecoxib that selectively inhibited COX-2 might block inflammation, pain, and fever while reducing the side effects (gastric erosions and ulcers) associated with inhibition of COX-1. In animal models of inflammation and pain, celecoxib has shown marked suppression of PG production and inflammation compared with indomethacin, the standard COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor. In clinical trials, celecoxib dosed at 100, 200, and 400 mg BID was found to significantly reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis. In one RA study, celecoxib was found to be as clinically effective as diclofenac after 24 weeks of treatment; at the end of the study, gastroduodenal ulcers occurred significantly more frequently in the diclofenac group (15%) than in the celecoxib group (4%). In a 1-week endoscopy study comparing celecoxib with naproxen and placebo, the incidence of gastric erosions/ulcers was significantly greater in the naproxen group than in the celecoxib or placebo group. The most common adverse effects of celecoxib in clinical studies were headache, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and dizziness. Celecoxib has shown significant equivalent anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy and has produced less endoscopically apparent gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration or erosion than have 3 classic NSAIDs. Whether it will have long-term GI adverse effects or interact with other medications to cause serious adverse responses (eg, increased GI bleeding or rash in conjunction with other sulfonamide-like drugs) is unknown and remains to be established. We showed previously that the selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, GPX-GI, encoded by the Gpx2 gene, is highly expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and sporadically in breast tissue. To investigate whether Gpx2 gene expression is epithelium specific, we used in situ hybridization to show that Gpx2 mRNA is highly expressed in the crypt epithelium of human intestine. We also used Northern analysis to study human breast cells and found Gpx2 mRNA in human mammary epithelial cell lines as well as freshly isolated normal breast epithelial cells. Because we identified three putative retinoic acid response elements (RARE) in the Gpx2 gene, we examined the regulation of the Gpx2 gene expression by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in RA-sensitive MCF-7 cells and RA-resistant HT29 cells. Without RA, MCF-7 cells had very low levels of Gpx2 mRNA and a low level of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity (17 mU/mg protein), whereas HT29 cells had a high level of Gpx2 mRNA and GPX activity (200 mU/mg protein). RA treatment increased Gpx2 mRNA level 3- to 11-fold and resulted in a fourfold increase of GPX activity (80 mU/mg protein) in MCF-7 cells. Neither Gpx2 mRNA level nor GPX activity was increased in HT29 cells. These results show that the Gpx2 gene is expressed in both breast and intestinal epithelium cells, and suggest that its expression can be highly regulated by retinoic acid, a known differentiation agent. A recent study (Niederreither et al. Nat Genet 1999;21:444-448 [Ref. 1]) describes the phenotype of a gene knockout for an enzyme, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH-2), that synthesizes retinoic acid (RA) in the early embryo. The effects generated by this single enzyme mutation are remarkably similar to those previously described in vitamin A-deprivation studies and compound retinoic acid receptor knockouts, which involve multiple systems of the embryo. With other data on the distribution of RA, its role in axial specification of the early embryo is considerably clarified. Surprisingly, it seems that head development is unaffected in these RALDH-2 knockout embryos; thus, the anterior of the embryo does not require RA, despite the observations that the hindbrain seems exquisitely sensitive to RA perturbation. Head development may be realised by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP26), which has been described recently. Between these two opposing forces, the hindbrain develops. Leptin blocks the insulin-like growth factor-I-induced increase in FSH-dependent estradiol-17beta (E(2)) production by rat ovarian granulosa cells (GC) in vitro. To determine whether the leptin effect extended to another positive modulator of FSH-dependent E(2) production, the direct ovarian effects of leptin on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were investigated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that theca-interstitial cells (TIC) from hypophysectomized rats expressed only a nonsignal-transducing isoform (OB-Ra) of leptin receptor mRNA. Leptin had no effect on TIC androgen production. In contrast, mRNAs for OB-Ra and the signal-transducing (OB-Rb) leptin receptor isoforms were expressed in GC. When GC obtained from 26-day-old rats were cultured (48 h) with FSH and androstenedione, both estrone (E(1)) and E(2) levels increased over those in untreated controls. In the presence of FSH (0.1 IU/ml), TGF-beta (10 ng/ml) potentiated E(2) and E(1) accumulation by 2.7- and 1.45-fold, respectively. Leptin did not alter basal or FSH-stimulated E(2) and E(1) levels. However, leptin suppressed the effect of TGF-beta on FSH-dependent E(2) and E(1) production by 39% and 29%, respectively. Aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450(arom)) mRNA expression and P450(arom) activity were increased by FSH and further augmented by the addition of TGF-beta. Leptin abolished the TGF-beta effect on P450(arom) mRNA expression, and it decreased P450(arom) activity by approximately 27%. These data support the hypothesis that leptin antagonizes the stimulatory effects of TGF-beta on FSH-dependent estrogen production by a mechanism involving the leptin-induced attenuation of P450(arom) activity and mRNA expression in GC. Synovial inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by the presence of large numbers of highly activated monocytes and macrophages. The importance of these cells in the aethiopathogenesis and prognosis of RA is increasingly recognised. The object of this report is to determine whether monocytes and monocyte derived macrophages of RA patients produce increased cytokine mRNA levels. Monocyte derived macrophages from RA patients and healthy controls were cultured either in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide. The expression levels of the mRNAs encoding GAPDH, interleukin 1beta (IL1beta), IL8, and alpha(2) macroglobulin in these cells were analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Activated monocyte derived macrophages from RA patients produce significantly higher IL8 mRNA levels than activated macrophages from healthy controls. By contrast, resting RA and control macrophages produce similar levels of IL8 mRNA. Culturing of activated macrophages in the presence of RA or control sera has no effect on the expression levels of IL8 mRNA. No significant differences between RA and control macrophages were observed in the expression levels of IL1beta and alpha(2) macroglobulin mRNAs. These data indicate that the increased IL8 mRNA production capacity of RA macrophages upon activation is an intrinsic property of these cells, and is not attributable to factors present in the circulation. Based on these observations, it is postulated that this innate hyper-responsiveness of RA macrophages contributes to the high IL8 levels present in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid joints, and is implicated in the chemotactic gradient leading to the homing of leucocytes to the joints. Haemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages are a common finding in patients with alveolar bleeding. Iron-positive macrophages, suggestive of subclinical alveolar bleeding, were found to be fairly common in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in primary systemic vasculitis but uncommon in collagen vascular diseases (CVDs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To substantiate the impression that subclinical alveolar bleeding may be a feature distinguishing between these disorders, fibreoptic bronchoscopy and BAL were performed in 49 patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis or Churg-Strauss syndrome and 44 patients with CVDs or RA, all of them without clinically manifest alveolar bleeding. The percentage of iron-positive cells was compared with clinical and radiological findings. Only a minority of the CVD and RA patients had iron-positive alveolar macrophages; the 95th percentile of the median number of such cells was 5%. Fifty-three per cent of the patients in the vasculitis group had >5% iron-positive cells, with individual counts ranging up to 95%. Patients with iron-positive macrophages had more extensive disease, more frequent microhaematuria, a higher antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titre, a higher myeloperoxidase concentration in the BAL fluid and somewhat more frequent low-attenuation opacities in pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography than the patients with a low iron-positive cell count. In conclusion, subclinical alveolar bleeding was, indeed, a common finding in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, which distinguished these disorders from lung disease due to collagen vascular diseases or rheumatoid arthritis. Its association with indices of disease activity, although weak in this cross-sectional study, merits a longitudinal study of its value for the long-term monitoring of vasculitis patients. Partial-thickness skin burns have been shown to induce neutrophil-dependent microvascular injury both locally (skin) and systemically (lung). In the present study, interventional measures to block inflammatory chemoattractants were employed to define the pathophysiologic role of these mediators in the development of secondary lung injury following thermal injury of skin. Rats were treated with blocking antibodies to either C5a or to the alpha-chemokines, keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), or macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To study the role of platelet activating factor, a receptor antagonist (PAF-Ra) was utilized. The development of lung vascular injury following thermal injury to skin was significantly attenuated by treatment with anti-C5a (84%), anti-KC (67%), and anti-MIP-2 (77%), but treatment with PAF-Ra had no protective effects. Protective interventions were paralleled by significant reductions in the tissue buildup of myeloperoxidase. When bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from thermally injured rats were evaluated, elevations in TNF;ZA and IL-1 were found and were determined to be C5a-dependent (but unaffected by treatment with PAF-Ra). These studies indicate that lung tissue injury after thermal skin burns is dependent on chemotactic mediators. The data also suggest that lung expression of TNFalpha and IL-1 after thermal injury of skin is C5a-dependent. Besides nuclear retinoid receptors and cellular retinoid binding proteins also retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzymes (using all-trans-retinal as substrate) and RA-catabolizing enzymes (producing hydroxylated products) may explain the specific effects of retinoids. In the past we have established an active role for 4-hydroxy-RA and 4-oxo-RA, which originally were considered to be inactive retinoids, but in fact are highly active modulators of positional specification in Xenopus development. Here we present evidence for a specific role of hydroxylated RA metabolites in the onset of neuronal differentiation. 4-Hydroxy- and 18-hydroxy-RA are products of the hydroxylation of RA by a novel cytochrome P450 (CYP)-type of enzyme, CYP26, expression of which is rapidly induced by RA. P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines stably expressing hCYP26 undergo extensive and rapid neuronal differentiation in monolayer at already low concentrations of RA, while normally P19 cells under these conditions differentiate only in endoderm-like cells. Our results indicate that the effects on growth inhibition and RARbeta transactivation of P19 EC cells are mediated directly by RA, while the onset of neuronal differentiation and the subsequent expression of neuronal markers is mediated by hCYP26 via the conversion of RA to its hydroxylated products. Antioxidant compounds have been extensively investigated as a pharmacological alternatives to prevent epileptogenesis. Rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA) are compounds with antioxidant properties, and RA has been shown to inhibit GABA transaminase activity (in vitro). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of RA and CA on seizures induced by pentylenotetrazole (PTZ) using the kindling model in mice. Male CF-1 mice were treated once every three days during 16days with RA (1, 2 or 4mg/kg; i.p.), or CA (1, 4 or 8mg/kg; i.p.), or positive controls diazepam (1mg/kg; i.p.) or vigabatrin (600mg/kg; p.o.), 30min before PTZ administration (50mg/kg; s.c.). After the last treatment, animals were sacrificed and the cortex was collected to evaluate free radicals (determined by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and genotoxic activity (Alkaline Comet Assay). Rosmarinic acid 2mg/kg increased latency and decreased percentage of seizures, only on the 4th day of observation. The other tested doses of RA and CA did not show any effect. Rosmarinic acid 1mg/kg, CA 4mg/kg and CA 8mg/kg decreased free radicals, but no dose altered the levels of enzyme SOD. In the comet assay, RA 4mg/kg and CA 4mg/kg reduced the DNA damage index. Some doses of rosmarinic acid and CA tested showed neuroprotective action against oxidative and DNA damage produced in the kindling epilepsy model, although they did not produce antiepileptogenic effect in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the genotype/allele frequencies of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) gene in Jordanian rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In addition, the association between MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and response to and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX) was evaluated. 159 adult rheumatoid arthritis ent Rheumatology Clinic at The Jordan University Hospital, between December, 2011 and April, 2012 were recruited into the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes using Wizard Genomic DNA extraction Kit. The DNA extracts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were subjected to restriction enzymes to identify the C677T and A1298C genotypes. Genotype frequencies were identified and their relationship to some measures of MTX response and toxicity were evaluated. The 677 TT genotype frequency was higher in RA patients (15.1%) compared to the healthy control group (5.9%) (odds ratio 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-6.87, p-value=0.0056). No such differences were seen with the A1298C genotypes. The frequencies of 677T and 1298C variant alleles were 0.346 and 0.296, respectively. None of the change-in-disease-activity measurements in MTX-treated patients has a significant association with the various genotypes. There was no significant association between A1298C genotypes and "Âany MTX toxicity"Â, but there was an association between C677T polymorphism and "Âany MTX toxicity"Â (p=0.037). In addition, there was no association between both SNPs and specific MTX adverse effects. However, some haplotypes or combinations of the C677T and A1298C genotypes were associated with certain MTX side effects. More data from a larger number of RA patients are needed to evaluate the role of pharmacogenetic studies of MTHFR gene in predicting MTX response and toxicity. Inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase-2 (HPH), leading to activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colitis. Rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with two catechols, a or inhibition of HPH. To improve accessibility of highly hydrophilic RA to HPH, an intracellular target, RA was chemically modified to decrease hydrophilicity. Of the less-hydrophilic derivatives, rosmarinic acid methyl ester (RAME) most potently inhibited HPH. Accordingly, RAME prevented hydroxylation of HIF-1Î± and consequently stabilized HIF-1Î± protein in cells. RAME inhibition of HPH and induction of HIF-1Î± were diminished by elevated doses of the required factors of HPH, 2-ketoglutarate and ascorbate. RAME induction of HIF-1Î± led to activation of an ulcer healing pathway, HIF-1-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in human colon carcinoma cells. RAME administered rectally ameliorated TNBS-induced rat colitis and substantially decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the inflamed colonic tissue. In parallel with the cellular effects of RAME, RAME up-regulated HIF-1Î± and VEGF in the inflamed colonic tissue. Thus, lipophilic modification of RA improves its ability to inhibit HPH, leading to activation of the HIF-1-VEGF pathway. RAME, a lipophilic RA derivative, may exert anti-colitic effects via activation of the ulcer healing pathway. Vertebrate enzymes that belong to the 16C family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR16C) were shown to play an essential role in the control of retinoic acid (RA) levels during development. To trace the evolution of enzymatic function of SDR16C family, and to examine the origins of the pathway for RA biosynthesis from vitamin A, we identified putative SDR16C enzymes through the extensive search of available genome sequencing data in a subset of species representing major metazoan phyla. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that enzymes from protostome, non-chordate deuterostome and invertebrate chordate species are found in three clades of SDR16C family containing retinoid active enzymes, which are retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10), retinol dehydrogenases E2 (RDHE2) and RDHE2-similar, and dehydrogenase reductase (SDR family) member 3 (DHRS3). For the initial functional analysis, we cloned RDH10- and RDHE2-related enzymes from the early developmental stages of a non-chordate deuterostome, green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus, and an invertebrate chordate, sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. In situ hybridization revealed that these proteins are expressed in a pattern relevant to development, while assays performed on proteins expressed in mammalian cell culture showed that they possess retinol-oxidizing activity as their vertebrate homologs. The existence of invertebrate homologs of DHRS3 was inferred from the analysis of phylogeny and cofactor-binding residues characteristic of preference for NADP(H). The presence of invertebrate homologs in the DHRS3 group of SDR16C is interesting in light of the complex mutually activating interaction, which we have recently described for human RDH10 and DHRS3 enzymes. Further functional analysis of these homologs will establish whether this interaction evolved to control retinoid homeostasis only in vertebrates, or is also conserved in pre-vertebrates. Progressive destruction of synovial joint cartilage and bone occurs in pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB). Through the screening of NF-ÎºB inhibitors by a luciferase reporter gene assay, we identified parthenolide (PAR) as the most potent NF-ÎºB inhibitor, among several PAR analogue compounds. This study was undertaken to determine whether PAR inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production, cartilage degradation, and inflammatory arthritis. The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Proteoglycan content and release were determined by measuring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye-binding assay. The potential role of PAR in treatment of arthritis was studied using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. We established that PAR, as a prototype compound, suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±-induced increases in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin (IL)-1Î² mRNA in chondrocytes. In addition, PAR prevented proteoglycan degradation triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines. PAR treatment at the onset of CIA symptoms significantly reduced synovitis, inflammation, and pannus formation scores. Reduced synovial inflammation after PAR treatment was also reflected in significantly less bone erosion and cartilage damage. These data indicate a protective effect of PAR on the catabolic insults of pro-inflammatory cytokines on chondrocyte metabolism and GAG release in vitro and in CIA. PAR had anti-inflammatory and structure-modifying effects on experimental arthritis, suggesting that PAR may be useful as a potential alternative or adjunct therapy for inflammatory arthritis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer are two very significant contributors to cancer-related deaths. Chronic alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for these cancers. Ethanol is oxidized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, an agent capable of initiating tumors by forming adducts with proteins and DNA. Acetaldehyde is metabolized by ALDH2, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1A1 to acetate. Retinoic acid (RA) is required for cellular differentiation and is known to arrest tumor development. RA is synthesized from retinaldehyde by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, specifically ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH8A1. By eliminating acetaldehyde and generating RA, ALDHs can play a crucial regulatory role in the initiation and progression of cancers. ALDH1 catalytic activity has been used as a biomarker to identify and isolate normal and cancer stem cells; its presence in a tumor is associated with poor prognosis in colon and pancreatic cancer. In summary, these ALDHs are not only biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic cancer but also play important mechanistic role in cancer initiation, progression, and eventual prognosis. To investigate changes in the gill proteome of fathead minnows continually fed an environmentally relevant dietary dose of (226)Ra for 2 years. The fish were fed a commercial diet containing 10 mBq-10 Bq (226)Ra g(-1). After 6 months and 2 years the gill proteome was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Protein spots which exhibited a significant change were identified using mass spectrometry. Six proteins were found to be increased: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase, protein disulphide isomerase precursor, ATP synthase, glial cell fibrillary protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). One protein was found to be decreased; malate dehydrogenase. The majority of these changes occurred predominantly at the lowest (226)Ra doses, within 6 months and were maintained for 2 years. These proteomic changes suggested an adaptive or protective response to radiation induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased GFAP indicated the induction of oxidative stress. Increased GAPDH and enolase indicated enhanced ROS scavenging from glycolytic metabolites. Increased protein disulphide isomerase precursor indicated an enhanced source of radioprotective thiols. Decreased malate dehydrogenase indicated enhanced ROS scavenging within the mitochondria. Increased ATP synthase indicated enhanced protection of healthy cells and increased ApoA1 indicated enhanced protection of the gill lamellae. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common life-threatening congenital anomaly resulting in high rates of perinatal death and neonatal respiratory distress. Some of the nonisolated forms are related to single-gene mutations or genomic rearrangements, but the genetics of the isolated forms (60% of cases) still remains a challenging issue. Retinoid signaling (RA) is critical for both diaphragm and lung development, and it has been hypothesized that subtle disruptions of this pathway could contribute to isolated CDH etiology. Here we used time series of normal and CDH lungs in humans, in nitrofen-exposed rats, and in surgically induced hernia in rabbits to perform a systematic transcriptional analysis of the RA pathway key components. The results point to CRPBP2, CY26B1, and ALDH1A2 as deregulated RA signaling genes in human CDH. Furthermore, the expression profile comparisons suggest that ALDH1A2 overexpression is not a primary event, but rather a consequence of the CDH-induced lung injury. Taken together, these data show that RA signaling disruption is part of CDH pathogenesis, and also that dysregulation of this pathway should be considered organ specifically. The bioavailability of orally administered therapies are often significantly limited in the human intestine by the metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Predicting whether candidate compounds induce CYP3A4 and P-gp is a crucial stage in the drug development process, as drug-drug interactions may result in the induction of intestinal CYP3A4 and P-gp. However, the assay systems needed to evaluate both CYP3A4 and P-gp induction in the intestine are yet to be established. To address this urgent requirement, LS174T cells were used to create two stable cell lines expressing the CYP3A4 or ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1, encoding P-gp) reporter genes. First, these stable cells were tested by treatment with 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) that induce CYP3A4 and P-gp in the intestines. All these compounds significantly increased both CYP3A4 and ABCB1 reporter activities in the stable cell lines. To simultaneously assess the induction of CYP3A4 and ABCB1, both stable cells were co-cultivated to measure their reporter activities. The mixed cells showed a significant increase in the CYP3A4 and ABCB1 reporter activities following treatment with 1,25(OH)2 D3, ATRA, and 9-cis RA. These activity levels were maintained after passaging more than 20 times and following multiple freeze-thaw cycles. These results demonstrate that our established cell lines can be used to evaluate simultaneously CYP3A4 and ABCB1 induction in the intestines, providing a valuable in vitro model for the evaluation of future drug candidates. Cytokine production is essential for innate and adaptive immunity against microbial invaders and must be tightly controlled. Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) is in constant flux between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and in transcription, splicing, or decay; such processes must be tightly controlled. Here, we report a novel function of Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) in modulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA levels in a cell type-specific manner. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, YB-1 interacts with IL-6 mRNA and actively transports it to the extracellular space by YB-1-enriched vesicles, resulting in the proper maintenance of intracellular IL-6 mRNA levels. YB-1 secretion occurs in a cell type-specific manner. Whereas macrophages actively secret YB-1, dendritic cells maintain it predominantly in the cytoplasm even in response to LPS. Intracellular YB-1 has the distinct function of regulating IL-6 mRNA stability in dendritic cells. Moreover, because LPS differentially regulates the expression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in macrophages and dendritic cells, this stimulus might control YB-1 acetylation differentially in both cell types. Taken together, these results suggest a unique feature of YB-1 in controlling intracellular IL-6 mRNA levels in a cell type-specific manner, thereby leading to functions that are dependent on the extracellular and intracellular distribution of YB-1. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are innate immune cells capable of suppressing T-cell responses. We previously reported the presence of MDSCs with a granulocytic phenotype in the synovial fluid (SF) of mice with proteoglycan (PG)-induced arthritis (PGIA), a T cell-dependent autoimmune model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the limited amount of SF-MDSCs precluded investigations into their therapeutic potential. The goals of this study were to develop an in vitro method for generating MDSCs similar to those found in SF and to reveal the therapeutic effect of such cells in PGIA. Murine bone marrow (BM) cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The phenotype of cultured cells was analyzed using flow cytometry, microscopy, and biochemical methods. The suppressor activity of BM-MDSCs was tested upon co-culture with activated T cells. To investigate the therapeutic potential of BM-MDSCs, the cells were injected into SCID mice at the early stage of adoptively transferred PGIA, and their effects on the clinical course of arthritis and PG-specific immune responses were determined. BM cells cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-6, and G-CSF became enriched in MDSC-like cells that showed greater phenotypic heterogeneity than MDSCs present in SF. BM-MDSCs profoundly inhibited both antigen-specific and polyclonal T-cell proliferation primarily via production of nitric oxide. Injection of BM-MDSCs into mice with PGIA ameliorated arthritis and reduced PG-specific T-cell responses and serum antibody levels. Our in vitro enrichment strategy provides a SF-like, but controlled microenvironment for converting BM myeloid precursors into MDSCs that potently suppress both T-cell responses and the progression of arthritis in a mouse model of RA. Our results also suggest that enrichment of BM in MDSCs could improve the therapeutic efficacy of BM transplantation in RA. Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2) potently suppresses the growth of various carcinomas, but the mechanism(s) that underlies this activity remains incompletely understood. CRABP2 displays two distinct functions. The classical function of this protein is to directly deliver retinoic acid (RA) to RA receptor (RAR), a nuclear receptor activated by this hormone, in turn inducing the expression of multiple antiproliferative genes. The other function of the protein is exerted in the absence of RA and mediated by the RNA-binding and stabilizing protein HuR. CRABP2 directly binds to HuR, markedly strengthens its interactions with target mRNAs, and thus increases their stability and up-regulates their expression. Here we show that the anticarcinogenic activities of CRABP2 are mediated by both of its functions. Transcriptome analyses revealed that, in the absence of RA, a large cohort of transcripts is regulated in common by CRABP2 and HuR, and many of these are involved in regulation of oncogenic properties. Furthermore, both in cultured cells and in vivo, CRABP2 or a CRABP2 mutant defective in its ability to cooperate with RAR but competent in interactions with HuR suppressed carcinoma growth and did so in the absence of RA. Hence, transcript stabilization by the CRABP2-HuR complex significantly contributes to the ability of CRABP2 to inhibit tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, the observations also revealed that HuR regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in nuclear pore formation and is required for nuclear import of CRABP2 and for transcriptional activation by RAR. The data thus point at a novel function for this important protein. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose pathogenesis and severity correlates with the presence of macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines within the inflamed synovium. Macrophage-derived cytokines fuel the pathological processes in RA and are targets of clinically successful therapies. However, although macrophage polarization determines cytokine production, the polarization state of macrophages in RA joints remains poorly defined. To dissect the molecular basis for the tissue-damaging effects of macrophages in RA joints, we undertook the phenotypic and transcriptomic characterization of ex vivo isolated CD14(+) RA synovial fluid (RA-SF) macrophages. Flow cytometry and gene profiling indicated that RA-SF macrophages express pro-inflammatory polarization markers (MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2), lack expression of markers associated with homeostatic and anti-inflammatory polarization (IGF1, HTR2B) and exhibit a transcriptomic profile that resembles the activin A-dependent gene signature of pro-inflammatory in vitro-generated macrophages. In fact, high levels of Smad-activating activin A were found in RA-SF and, accordingly, the Smad signalling pathway was activated in ex vivo-isolated RA-SF macrophages. In vitro experiments on monocytes and macrophages indicated that RA-SF promoted the acquisition of pro-inflammatory markers (INHBA, MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2) but led to a significant reduction in the expression of genes associated with homeostasis and inflammation resolution (FOLR2, SERPINB2, IGF1, CD36), thus confirming the pro-inflammatory polarization ability of RA-SF. Importantly, the macrophage-polarizing ability of RA-SF was inhibited by an anti-activin A-neutralizing antibody, thus demonstrating that activin A mediates the pro-inflammatory macrophage-polarizing ability of RA-SF. Moreover, and in line with these findings, multicolour immunofluorescence evidenced that macrophages within RA synovial membranes (RA-SM) also express pro-inflammatory polarization markers whose expression is activin A-dependent. Altogether, our results demonstrate that macrophages from RA synovial fluids and membranes exhibit an MMP12(+) EGLN3(+) CCR2(+) pro-inflammatory polarization state whose acquisition is partly dependent on activin A from the synovial fluid. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) has been reported to suppress Th1 responses and enhance Th2 responses. Here, we investigated whether differences in vitamin A metabolism could underlie the differences between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, which are reportedly seen as Th1 and Th2 responders, respectively. BALB/c mice were shown to have higher intestinal epithelial expression of RALDH1 (where RALDH is retinaldehyde dehydrogenase), and, consequently, higher RALDH activity in MLN-DCs, leading to an increased ability to induce IgA class switching in B cells. Furthermore, within BALB/c mice, induction of IgA secretion as well as increased accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the intestinal lamina propria was observed. Additionally, as BALB/c mice are more resistant to dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) induced colitis, mice that lacked vitamin A in their diet had a more severe form of DSS-induced colitis compared to control mice. Therefore, the level of RA production and consequently the degree of RA-mediated signaling is crucial for the efficiency of the mucosal immune system. Gold(I) complexes are an important tool in the arsenal of established approaches for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while some recent studies have suggested that gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) may also be therapeutically efficacious. These observations prompted the current biological studies involving gold(I) anti-RA agents and Au NPs, which are aimed towards improving our knowledge of how they work. The cytotoxicity of auranofin, aurothiomalate, aurothiosulfate and Au NPs towards RAW264.7 macrophages was evaluated using the MTT assay, with the former compound proving to be the most toxic. The extent of cellular uptake of the various gold agents was determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, while their distribution within macrophages was examined using microprobe synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The latter technique showed accumulation of gold in discrete regions of the cell, and co-localisation with sulfur in the case of cells treated with aurothiomalate or auranofin. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to characterize thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in which the penultimate selenocysteine residue was replaced by cysteine. Mass spectra of solutions of TrxR and aurothiomalate, aurothiosulfate or auranofin showed complexes containing bare gold atoms bound to the protein, or protein adducts containing gold atoms retaining some of their initial ligands. These results support TrxR being an important target of gold(I) drugs used to treat RA, while the finding that Au NPs are incorporated into macrophages, but elicit little toxicity, indicates further exploration of their potential for treatment of RA is warranted. Retinoic acid (RA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A and plays important roles in embryonic development. CYP26 enzymes degrade RA and have specific expression patterns that produce a RA gradient, which regulates the patterning of various structures in the embryo. However, it has not been addressed whether a RA gradient also exists and functions in organs after birth. We found localized RA activities in the diaphyseal portion of the growth plate cartilage were associated with the specific expression of Cyp26b1 in the epiphyseal portion in juvenile mice. To disturb the distribution of RA, we generated mice lacking Cyp26b1 specifically in chondrocytes (Cyp26b1(Îchon) cKO). These mice showed reduced skeletal growth in the juvenile stage. Additionally, their growth plate cartilage showed decreased proliferation rates of proliferative chondrocytes, which was associated with a reduced height in the zone of proliferative chondrocytes, and closed focally by four weeks of age, while wild-type mouse growth plates never closed. Feeding the Cyp26b1 cKO mice a vitamin A-deficient diet partially reversed these abnormalities of the growth plate cartilage. These results collectively suggest that Cyp26b1 in the growth plate regulates the proliferation rates of chondrocytes and is responsible for the normal function of the growth plate and growing bones in juvenile mice, probably by limiting the RA distribution in the growth plate proliferating zone. We investigated the protective effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) on testicular damage induced by doxorubicin (DXR) in rats. In total, 21 rats were divided into 3 groups: the control group that received no treatment, the DXR group that received intraperitoneal (i.p.) DXR on day 7 and the DXR + RA group that received intragastric RA for 10 days with i.p. DXR on day 7. The rats were sacrificed on day 11 for histological and biochemical analyses. To assess oxidative damage, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. The median modified Johnsen score of the DXR + RA group was higher than that of the DXR group (p = 0.002). The rats with the narrowest seminiferous tubules were in the DXR group (0.17 Â± 0.03), and the difference between the DXR + RA and DXR groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002). The number of apoptotic cells in the DXR group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and there were significantly fewer apoptotic cells in the DXR + RA group than in the DXR group (p = 0.002). The MDA level was lowest in the control group and highest in the DXR group, and the level observed in the DXR + RA group significantly lower than that in the DXR group (p = 0.002). The GPx level was highest in the control group, with the level observed in the DXR + RA group significantly higher than that in the DXR group (p = 0.002). The testosterone level was lowest in the DXR group and highest in the control group, and that observed in the DXR + RA group was significantly higher than that in the DXR group (p = 0.018). RA can correct DXR-induced testicular damage through its antioxidant properties. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of RA requires further investigation, and long-term and comparative human studies are also needed. Retinoic acid (RA) is a critical regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in various cell types. Recently, the RA-metabolizing enzyme CYP26A1 (cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) has been shown to have an oncogenic function in breast carcinogenesis. However, the relevance of elevated CYP26A1 expression in human cancers remains to be clarified. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of CYP26A1 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its precursors, including low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively), as well as head and neck cancer (HNC). The association between CYP26A1 expression and a number of clinicopathological parameters was also evaluated. CYP26A1 was not expressed in normal cervical epithelium. CYP26A1 expression was present in LSIL but limited to basal and parabasal cells. HSIL cases exhibited strong nuclear expression of CYP26A1 and mixed cytoplasmic expression patterns with widely distributed expression toward the epithelial surface. Importantly, strong cytoplasmic staining of CYP26A1 was observed in 19 of 50 (38%) patients with cervical SCC. Elevated expression of CYP26A1 was significantly associated with younger age (<50 years) and lymph node involvement (pN). Similarly, CYP26A1 was not expressed in non-neoplastic tissues of the head and neck, but strong cytoplasmic staining of CYP26A1 was observed in 52 of 128 (41%) HNC cases. Such strong CYP26A1 expression was significantly associated with the primary tumor stage of carcinomas (pT) and the pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) stage in HNC. Our results indicated an elevated CYP26A1 expression in malignant and precancerous dysplastic lesions of the human cervix, which also increased with the progression of cervical squamous neoplasia. In addition, this report is the first to demonstrate the increased expression of CYP26A1 in HNC and its significant correlation with primary tumor growth. These data suggested that CYP26A1 overexpression might contribute to the development and progression of cervical malignancies and squamous neoplasia of the head and neck. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is an isoform of SOD normally found both intra- and extra-cellularly and accounting for most SOD activity in blood vessels. Here we explored the role of EC-SOD in protecting against brain damage induced by chronic hypoxia. EC-SOD Transgenic mice, were exposed to hypoxia (FiO2.1%) for 10 days (H-KI) and compared to transgenic animals housed in room air (RA-KI), wild type animals exposed to hypoxia (H-WT or wild type mice housed in room air (RA-WT). Overall brain metabolism evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) showed that H-WT mice had significantly higher uptake of 18FDG in the brain particularly the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. H-KI mice had comparable uptake to the RA-KI and RA-WT groups. To investigate the functional state of the hippocampus, electrophysiological techniques in ex vivo hippocampal slices were performed and showed that H-KI had normal synaptic plasticity, whereas H-WT were severely affected. Markers of oxidative stress, GFAP, IBA1, MIF, and pAMPK showed similar values in the H-KI and RA-WT groups, but were significantly increased in the H-WT group. Caspase-3 assay and histopathological studies showed significant apoptosis/cell damage in the H-WT group, but no significant difference in the H-KI group compared to the RA groups. The data suggest that EC-SOD has potential prophylactic and therapeutic roles in diseases with compromised brain oxygenation. Statins increase the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to assess whether this increase in risk is a consequence of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the intended drug target. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HMGCR gene, rs17238484 (for the main analysis) and rs12916 (for a subsidiary analysis) as proxies for HMGCR inhibition by statins. We examined associations of these variants with plasma lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations; bodyweight; waist circumference; and prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. Study-specific effect estimates per copy of each LDL-lowering allele were pooled by meta-analysis. These findings were compared with a meta-analysis of new-onset type 2 diabetes and bodyweight change data from randomised trials of statin drugs. The effects of statins in each randomised trial were assessed using meta-analysis. Data were available for up to 223â463 individuals from 43 genetic studies. Each additional rs17238484-G allele was associated with a mean 0Â·06 mmol/L (95% CI 0Â·05-0Â·07) lower LDL cholesterol and higher body weight (0Â·30 kg, 0Â·18-0Â·43), waist circumference (0Â·32 cm, 0Â·16-0Â·47), plasma insulin concentration (1Â·62%, 0Â·53-2Â·72), and plasma glucose concentration (0Â·23%, 0Â·02-0Â·44). The rs12916 SNP had similar effects on LDL cholesterol, bodyweight, and waist circumference. The rs17238484-G allele seemed to be associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] per allele 1Â·02, 95% CI 1Â·00-1Â·05); the rs12916-T allele association was consistent (1Â·06, 1Â·03-1Â·09). In 129â170 individuals in randomised trials, statins lowered LDL cholesterol by 0Â·92 mmol/L (95% CI 0Â·18-1Â·67) at 1-year of follow-up, increased bodyweight by 0Â·24 kg (95% CI 0Â·10-0Â·38 in all trials; 0Â·33 kg, 95% CI 0Â·24-0Â·42 in placebo or standard care controlled trials and -0Â·15 kg, 95% CI -0Â·39 to 0Â·08 in intensive-dose vs moderate-dose trials) at a mean of 4Â·2 years (range 1Â·9-6Â·7) of follow-up, and increased the odds of new-onset type 2 diabetes (OR 1Â·12, 95% CI 1Â·06-1Â·18 in all trials; 1Â·11, 95% CI 1Â·03-1Â·20 in placebo or standard care controlled trials and 1Â·12, 95% CI 1Â·04-1Â·22 in intensive-dose vs moderate dose trials). The increased risk of type 2 diabetes noted with statins is at least partially explained by HMGCR inhibition. The funding sources are cited at the end of the paper. The clinical significance of myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been the focus of investigation because it may contribute to the chronic, non-microbial inflammatory process in various diseases. Here, we determined serum MPO levels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and investigated the associations between MPO levels and disease activity indicators in RA. The distribution of MPO was determined in serum samples from patients with RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (pSS), dermatomyositis (DM), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and from healthy controls using commercial ELISA kits. Associations of serum MPO levels with the disease variables of RA patients were evaluated. All patient samples analyzed showed higher serum levels of MPO than healthy controls. Furthermore, MPO levels in RA were significantly higher than those in the other diseases with the exception of DM. Higher MPO levels were observed in RA patients with increased C-reactive protein (p=0.005) or neutrophil percentage (p<0.001), as well as in those with highly active disease (p<0.001). Moderate positive correlations between MPO levels and IgM (r=0.334, p=0.001), C-reactive protein (r=0.293, p=0.003), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.240, p=0.016), or DAS28 (r=0.350, p<0.001) were also demonstrated. The MPO concentration is likely to increase in patients with chronic inflammation. The associations between MPO and the disease variables of RA patients support a role for MPO in the inflammatory process of the disease. Despite the high prevalence of chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori, the gastric mucosa has received little investigative attention as a unique immune environment. Here, we analyzed whether retinoic acid (RA), an important homeostatic factor in the small intestinal mucosa, also contributes to gastric immune regulation. We report that human gastric tissue contains high levels of the RA precursor molecule retinol (ROL), and that gastric epithelial cells express both RA biosynthesis genes and RA response genes, indicative of active RA biosynthesis. Moreover, primary gastric epithelial cells cultured in the presence of ROL synthesized RA in vitro and induced RA biosynthesis in co-cultured monocytes through an RA-dependent mechanism, suggesting that gastric epithelial cells may also confer the ability to generate RA on gastric dendritic cells (DCs). Indeed, DCs purified from gastric mucosa had similar levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and RA biosynthesis gene expression as small intestinal DCs, although gastric DCs lacked CD103. In H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, gastric RA biosynthesis gene expression was severely disrupted, which may lead to reduced RA signaling and thus contribute to disease progression. Collectively, our results support a critical role for RA in human gastric immune regulation. The tissue availability of active glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans) depends on their rate of synthesis from cholesterol, downstream metabolism, excretion and interconversion. The latter is mediated by the 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11Î²HSDs). In this review, we summarize the features of the two isoenzymes, 11Î²HSD1 and 11Î²HSD2, and current available experimental data related to 11Î²HSDs, which are relevant in the context of synovial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conclude that due to complex feedback mechanisms inherent to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, currently available transgenic animal models cannot display the full potential otherwise inherent to the techniques. Studies with tissue explants, mixed synovial cell preparations, cell lines derived from synovial cells, and related primary cells or established cell lines indicate that there are relatively clear differences between the two isoenzymes. 11Î²HSD1 is expressed primarily in fibroblasts and osteoblasts, and may be responsible for fibroblast survival and aid in the resolution of inflammation, but it is also involved in bone damage. 11Î²HSD2 is expressed primarily in macrophages and lymphocytes, and may be responsible for their survival, suggesting that it is critical in chronic inflammation. The situation in synovial tissue would allow 11Î²HSD2-expressing cells to tap the energy resources of 11Î²HSD1-expressing cells. The overall properties of this local glucocorticoid interconversion system might limit therapeutic use of glucocorticoids in RA. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel. Histone methylation changes and formation of chromatin loops involving enhancers, promoters and 3' end regions of genes have been variously associated with active transcription in eukaryotes. We have studied the effect of activation of the retinoic A receptor, at the RARE-promoter chromatin of CASP9 and CYP26A1 genes, 15 and 45 min following RA exposure, and we found that histone H3 lysines 4 and 9 are demethylated by the lysine-specific demethylase, LSD1 and by the JMJ-domain containing demethylase, D2A. The action of the oxidase (LSD1) and a dioxygenase (JMJD2A) in the presence of Fe++ elicits an oxidation wave that locally modifies the DNA and recruits the enzymes involved in base and nucleotide excision repair (BER and NER). These events are essential for the formation of chromatin loop(s) that juxtapose the RARE element with the 5' transcription start site and the 3' end of the genes. The RARE bound-receptor governs the 5' and 3' end selection and directs the productive transcription cycle of RNA polymerase. These data mechanistically link chromatin loops, histone methylation changes and localized DNA repair with transcription. Although many regulatory networks involved in defining definitive endoderm have been identified, the mechanisms through which these networks interact to pattern the endoderm are less well understood. To explore the mechanisms involved in midgut patterning, we dissected the transcriptional regulatory elements of nephrocan (Nepn), the earliest known midgut specific gene in mice. We observed that Nepn expression is dramatically reduced in Sox17(-/-) and Raldh2(-/-) embryos compared with wild-type embryos. We further show that Nepn is directly regulated by Sox17 and the retinoic acid (RA) receptor via two enhancer elements located upstream of the gene. Moreover, Nepn expression is modulated by Activin signaling, with high levels inhibiting and low levels enhancing RA-dependent expression. In Foxh1(-/-) embryos in which Nodal signaling is reduced, the Nepn expression domain is expanded into the anterior gut region, confirming that Nodal signaling can modulate its expression in vivo. Together, Sox17 is required for Nepn expression in the definitive endoderm, while RA signaling restricts expression to the midgut region. A balance of Nodal/Activin signaling regulates the anterior boundary of the midgut expression domain. The class 1A aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1A) subfamily of genes encode enzymes that function at the apex of the retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathway. We detected aberrant expression of ALDH1A genes, particularly ALDH1A2, in a majority (72%) of primary paediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) specimens. ALDH1A expression was almost exclusive to T-lineage, but not B-lineage, ALL. To determine whether ALDH1A expression may have relevance to T-ALL cell growth and survival, the effect of inhibiting ALDH1A function was measured on a panel of human ALL cell lines. This revealed that T-ALL proliferation had a higher sensitivity to modulation of ALDH1A activity and RA signalling as compared to ALL cell lines of B-lineage. Consistent with these findings, the genes most highly correlated with ALDH1A2 expression were involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Evidence that such genes may be targets of regulation via RA signalling initiated by ALDH1A activity was provided by the TNFRSF10B gene, encoding the apoptotic death receptor TNFRSF10B (also termed TRAIL-R2), which negatively correlated with ALDH1A2 and showed elevated transcription following treatment of T-ALL cell lines with the ALDH1A inhibitor citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal). These data indicate that ALDH1A expression is a common event in T-ALL and supports a role for these enzymes in the pathobiology of this disease. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a very potent lipid mediator produced from arachidonic acid (AA) through the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, is implicated in the regulation of dendritic cell (DC) functions such as differentiation ability, cytokine-producing capacity, Th-cell polarizing ability, migration and maturation. DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and play major roles in both the induction of primary immune responses and tolerance. It is well established that PGE2 functions significantly in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although the role of PGE2 in RA has been studied extensively, the effects of PGE2 on DC biology and the role of DCs in RA have not become the focus of investigation until recently. Here, we summarize the latest progress in PGE2 research with respect to DC functions, as well as the role of PGE2 receptor signaling of DCs in the pathogenesis of RA. Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are characterized by the presence of activated astrocytes, which are thought to actively take part in propagating lesion progression by secreting pro-inflammatory mediators. Conversely, reactive astrocytes may exert disease-dampening effects through the production of trophic factors and anti-inflammatory mediators. Astrocytic control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for normal brain homeostasis and BBB disruption is a well-established early event in MS lesion development. Here, we set out to unravel potential protective effects of reactive astrocytes on BBB function under neuroinflammatory conditions as seen in MS, where we focus on the role of the brain morphogen retinoic acid (RA). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), a key enzyme for RA synthesis, is highly expressed by reactive astrocytes throughout white matter lesions compared to control and normal appearing white matter. In vitro modeling of reactive astrocytes resulted in increased expression of RALDH2, enhanced RA synthesis, and a protective role for astrocyte-derived RA on BBB function during inflammation-induced barrier loss. Furthermore, RA induces endothelial immune quiescence and decreases monocyte adhesion under inflammatory conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that RA attenuated oxidative stress in inflamed endothelial cells, through activation of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2 related factor 2. In summary, RA synthesis by reactive astrocytes represents an endogenous protective response to neuroinflammation, possibly aimed at protecting the BBB against inflammatory insult. A better understanding of RA signaling in MS pathophysiology may lead to the discovery of novel targets to halt disease progression. Our previous works demonstrated that systemic orbital fat-derived stem cell (OFSC) transplantation was effective in ameliorating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced extensive acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo mainly through paracrine regulation of macrophage-mediated cytokine-storm. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism(s) of OFSCs regulating macrophage activity in a cytokine-inducible fashion. LPS (100 ng/ml)-activated macrophages were treated by conditioned medium from OFSCs (OFSCs-CM) or non-contact cultured with OFSCs for 6 hours. The potency of OFSCs on macrophage proliferation and pro-inflammation ability were determined. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, inducible immuno-modulatory factors in OFSCs, were investigated. Deep sequencing analysis as well as interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and genes of immuno-modulators in OFSCs induced by activated macrophages was predicted by miRTar. Transfection of miRNA inhibitor into OFSCs was performed. Real-time RT-PCR and transplantation of OFSCs into mice with LPS-induced ALI confirmed the in vitro and in vivo mechanism. The paracrine effect of OFSCs on inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine release was more potent than induction of macrophage G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. OFSCs-CM suppressed LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthetase and the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta expression in macrophages. Under non-contact culture, LPS-activated macrophages effectively triggered the expression of soluble immuno-modulating factors in OFSCs, i.e., IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF RII). Under miRTar prediction, miR-671-5p was identified as a critical microRNA in regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors in OFSCs response to macrophages. The baseline level of miR-671-5p was high in OFSCs, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p upon co-culture with activated macrophages was observed. MiR-671-5p inhibitor transfection into OFSCs selectively enhanced the IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expressions. In addition, inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability against LPS-induced ALI. The paracrine effect of OFSCs inhibits the pro-inflammatory ability and proliferation of macrophages. The immune-modulation capacity of OFSCs can be triggered by activated macrophages, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p enhances OFSC immuno-modulation ability by up-regulating IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expression. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A enzymes produce retinoic acid (RA), a transcription induction molecule. To investigate if ALDH1A1 or ALDH1A3-mediated RA signaling has an active role in breast cancer tumorigenesis, we performed gene expression and tumor xenograft studies. Analysis of breast patient tumors revealed that high levels of ALDH1A3 correlated with expression of RA-inducible genes with retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), poorer patient survival and triple-negative breast cancers. This suggests a potential link between ALDH1A3 expression and RA signaling especially in aggressive and/or triple-negative breast cancers. In MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435 cells, ALDH1A3 and RA increased expression of RA-inducible genes. Interestingly, ALDH1A3 had opposing effects in tumor xenografts, increasing tumor growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells, but decreasing tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells. Exogenous RA replaced ALDH1A3 in inducing the same opposing tumor growth and metastasis effects, suggesting that ALDH1A3 mediates these effects by promoting RA signaling. Genome expression analysis revealed that ALDH1A3 induced largely divergent gene expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells which likely resulted in the opposing tumor growth effects. Treatment with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine restored uniform RA-inducibility of RARE-containing HOXA1 and MUC4 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, suggesting that differences in epigenetic modifications contribute to differential ALDH1A3/RA-induced gene expression in breast cancer. In summary, ALDH1A3 induces differential RA signaling in breast cancer cells which affects the rate of breast cancer progression. Nature utilizes oxido-reductases to cater to the energy demands of most biochemical processes in respiratory species. Oxido-reductases are capable of meeting this challenge by utilizing redox active sites, often containing transition metal ions, which facilitate movement and relocation of electrons/protons to create a potential gradient that is used to energize redox reactions. There has been a consistent struggle by researchers to estimate the electron transfer rate constants in physiologically relevant processes. This review provides a brief background on the measurements of electron transfer rates in biological molecules, in particular Cu-containing enzymes, and highlights the recent advances in monitoring these electron transfer events at the single molecule level or better to say, at the individual event level. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. However, 50-70% of the patients respond to treatment and 30% suffer toxicity. To identify pharmacogenetic markers of outcome in RA patients treated with MTX. We analyzed 27 genetic variants in DHFR, TYMS, MTHFR, ATIC and CCND1 genes. We included 124 RA patients treated with MTX monotherapy. In multivariate analyses two variants in the MTHFR gene were associated with response, rs17421511 (p = 0.024) and rs1476413 (p = 0.0086), as well as one in the DHFR gene, rs1643650 (p = 0.026). The ATIC rs16853826 variant was associated with toxicity (p = 0.039). MTHFR, DHFR and ATIC genetic variants can be considered as pharmacogenetic markers of outcome in RA patients under MTX monotherapy. Oxidative stress plays a key role in several ailments including neurodegenerative conditions. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the effect of rosmarinic acid (RA) in preventing oxidative stress related death of neuronal cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrated direct neuroprotective effect of RA using H2O2-induced oxidative challenge in N2A mouse neuroblastoma cells. The mechanism of neutralization of H2O2-induced toxicity by RA was evaluated using MTT, lactate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular ROS, and comet assays. Up-regulation of brain neuronal markers at molecular level was performed by RT-PCR. Results presented in the paper indicate that H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in N2A cells was suppressed by treatment with RA. Moreover, RA is very effective in attenuating the disruption of lactate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ROS. Pretreatment with RA significantly prevents genotoxicity (3.7-fold, p<0.01) and promotes the up-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (4.5-fold, p<0.01), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes (5.4-fold, p<0.01) against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in N2A cells. Our results revealed that N2A cells are suitable cellular models to evaluate neuroprotective effects of RA, and suggest that RA may potentially serve as an agent for prevention of several human neurodegenerative diseases caused by oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to employ precursor-feeding strategy for the improved production of rosmarinic acid (RA) in Solenostemon scutellarioides in vitro. The cultures were fed with precursors, namely l-phenylalanine (Phe), l-tyrosine (Tyr) and cucumber juice (CJ), at different concentrations. Phe (100 mg L(-1)) and Tyr (400 mg L(-1)) caused â¼1.5- and 2.1-fold increase in RA accumulation within 48 h. CJ (50 mg L(-1)) feeding displayed highest RA content (â¼1.6-fold) in 72 h. In this study, we focused on the function of individual precursor on key enzymes involved in RA biosynthesis. The phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity was significantly upregulated after Phe (100 mg L(-1)) feeding, while tyrosine aminotransferase and hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase activities were improved with Tyr (400 mg L(-1)) treatment. However, rosmarinic acid synthase activity was significantly enhanced by all three precursors. In synergy study, Phe (100 mg L(-1)) + Tyr (400 mg L(-1)) could enhance (â¼3.1-fold) RA biosynthesis within 48 h. Oxidative stress (OS) is important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its experimental model--adjuvant arthritis (AA). Antioxidants are scarcely studied in autoimmunity, and future analyses are needed to assess its effects in ameliorating these diseases. Although there are studies about antioxidants effects on the course of RA, their role in combination therapy has not yet been studied in detail, especially on extra-articular manifestations of AA. During the 28-d administration of pinosylvin (PIN) in monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to AA rats, we evaluated the impact of the treatment on selected parameters. The experiment included: healthy controls, untreated AA, AA administered 50âmg/kg b.w. of PIN daily p.o., AA administered 0.4âmg/kg b.w. of MTX twice weekly p.o. and AA treated with a combination of PIN+MTX. AA was monitored using: hind paw volume, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and F2-isoprostanes in plasma, Î³-glutamyltransferase activity in spleen, activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) in lung, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) in liver and lung. PIN monotherapy significantly improved the activation of NF-ÎºB in liver and lung, HO-1 expression and activity of LOX in the lung, MCP-1 levels in plasma (on 14thâd) and plasmatic levels of F2-isoprostanes. An important contribution of PIN to MTX effect was the reduction of OS (an increase of HO-1 expression in lung and reduction of plasmatic TBARS) and decrease of LOX activity in the lung. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid; 13-cRA) is a differentiation inducer used to treat minimal residual disease after myeloablative therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. However, more than 40% of children develop recurrent disease during or after 13-cRA treatment. The plasma concentrations of 13-cRA in earlier studies were considered subtherapeutic while 4-oxo-13-cis-RA (4-oxo-13-cRA), a metabolite of 13-cRA considered by some investigators as inactive, were greater than threefold higher than 13-cRA. We sought to define the metabolic pathways of 13-cRA and investigated the anti-tumour activity of its major metabolite, 4-oxo-13-cRA. Effects of 13-cRA and 4-oxo-13-cRA on human neuroblastoma cell lines were assessed by DIMSCAN and flow cytometry for cell proliferation, MYCN down-regulation by reverse transcription PCR and immunoblotting, and neurite outgrowth by confocal microscopy. 13-cRA metabolism was determined using tandem MS in human liver microsomes and in patient samples. Six major metabolites of 13-cRA were identified in patient samples. Of these, 4-oxo-13-cRA was the most abundant, and 4-oxo-13-cRA glucuronide was also detected at a higher level in patients. CYP3A4 was shown to play a major role in catalysing 13-cRA to 4-oxo-13-cRA. In human neuroblastoma cell lines, 4-oxo-13-cRA and 13-cRA were equi-effective at inducing neurite outgrowth, inhibiting proliferation, decreasing MYCN mRNA and protein, and increasing the expression of retinoic acid receptor-Î² mRNA and protein levels. We showed that 4-oxo-13-cRA is as active as 13-cRA against neuroblastoma cell lines. Plasma levels of both 13-cRA and 4-oxo-13-cRA should be evaluated in pharmacokinetic studies of isotretinoin in neuroblastoma. Aging results in attenuation of abilities to mount appropriate immune responses. The influence of aging on CD4(+) T cell migration ability toward chemokines was investigated with young and aged mice. We found functional decline in migration ability toward CCL19 and also decreased CCR7 expression level in antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells from aged mice compared with those from young mice. Upon addition of retinoic acid (RA), CD4(+) T cells from aged mice showed decreased CCR9 expression level compared to young mice and the migration ability of CD4(+) T cells from aged mice toward CCL25 was attenuated compared to young mice. We also observed that the expression of RALDH2 mRNA was decreased in mesenteric lymph node dendritic cells from aged mice compared to those from young mice. These results demonstrate that attenuated migration abilities of CD4(+) T cells were observed in aged mice, which correlated with decreased chemokine receptor expression. Furthermore, the reduced production and response to RA by aging may be one of the causes of such attenuated migration abilities in the intestinal immune system. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) has been proposed as a candidate biomarker for colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, the heterogeneity of its expression makes it difficult to predict the outcome of CRC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of this molecule in CRC. In this study, we examined ALDH1A1 expression by immunohistochemistry including 406 cases of primary CRC with corresponding adjacent mucosa, with confirmation of real-time PCR and Western blotting. We found that the expression patterns of ALDH1A1 were heterogeneous in the CRC and corresponding adjacent tissues. We defined the ratio of ALDH1A1 level in adjacent mucosa to that in tumor tissues as RA/C and found that the capabilities of tumor invasion and metastasis in the tumors with RA/C < 1 were significantly higher than those with RA/C â¥ 1. Follow-up data showed the worse prognoses in the CRC patients with RA/C < 1. For understanding the underlying mechanism, the localization of Î²-catenin was detected in the CRC tissues with different patterns of ALDH1A1 expression from 221 patients and Î²-catenin was found preferentially expressed in cell nuclei of the tumors with RA/C < 1 and ALDH1A1(high) expression of HT29 cell line, indicating that nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin might contribute to the increased potentials of invasion and metastasis. Our results indicate that RA/C is a novel biomarker to reflect the distinct expression patterns of ALDH1A1 for predicting metastasis and prognosis of CRC. The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is an important determinant of intestinal immunity. RA primes dendritic cells (DCs) to express CD103 and produce RA themselves, which induces the gut-homing receptors Î±4Î²7 and CCR9 on T cells and amplifies transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²-mediated development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here we investigated the effect of RA on human DCs and subsequent development of T cells. We report a novel role of RA in immune regulation by showing that RA-conditioned human DCs did not substantially enhance Foxp3 but induced Î±4Î²7(+) CCR9(+) T cells expressing high levels of interleukin (IL)-10, which were functional suppressive Treg cells. IL-10 production was dependent on DC-derived RA and was maintained when DCs were stimulated with toll-like receptor ligands. Furthermore, the presence of TGF-Î² during RA-DC-driven T-cell priming favored the induction of Foxp3(+) Treg cells over IL-10(+) Treg cells. Experiments with naive CD4(+) T cells stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the absence of DCs emphasized that RA induces IL-10 in face of inflammatory mediators. The data thus show for the first time that RA induces IL-10-producing Treg cells and postulates a novel mechanism for IL-10 in maintaining tolerance to the intestinal microbiome. Calreticulin (CRT) is a multi-functional endoplasmic reticulum protein implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was undertaken to determine whether CRT was involved in angiogenesis via the activating nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathway. We explored the profile of CRT expression in RA (including serum, synovial fluid and synovial tissue). In order to investigate the role of CRT on angiogenesis, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and cultured in this study for in-vitro experiments. Our results showed a significantly higher concentration of CRT in serum (5Â·4âÂ±â2Â·2âng/ml) of RA patients compared to that of osteoarthritis (OA, 3Â·6âÂ±â0Â·9âng/ml, Pâ<â0Â·05) and healthy controls (HC, 3Â·7âÂ±â0Â·6âng/ml, Pâ<â0Â·05); and significantly higher CRT in synovial fluid (5Â·8âÂ±â1Â·2âng/ml) of RAâversusâOA (3Â·7âÂ±â0Â·3âng/ml, Pâ<â0Â·05). High levels of CRT are expressed in synovial membrane localized predominantly to inflammatory cells and synovial perivascular areas in both the lining and sublining layers of RA synovial tissue (RAST). Increased nitric oxide (NO) production and phosphorylation level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were measured in HUVECs following CRT stimulation, while the total eNOS expression was not significantly changed. Furthermore, CRT promoted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, which were significantly inhibited by a specific eNOS inhibitor. These findings suggested that CRT may be involved in angiogenesis events in RA through NO signalling pathways, which may provide a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of RA. Liver steatosis can evolve to steatohepatitis (NASH) through a series of biochemical steps related to oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Antioxidants, such as silybin, have been proposed as a treatment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. In this study, we evaluated, in patients with histologically documented NASH, the oxidant/antioxidant status and lipid "fingerprint" in the serum of NASH patients, both in basal conditions and after 12 months of treatment with silybin-based food integrator Realsil (RA). The oxidant/antioxidant status analysis showed the presence of a group of patients with higher basal severity of disease (NAS scores 4.67âÂ±â2.5) and a second group corresponding to borderline NASH (NAS scoresâ=â3.8âÂ±â1.5). The chronic treatment with RA changed the NAS score in both groups that reached the statistical significance only in group 2, in which there was also a significant decrease of serum lipid peroxidation. The lipidomic profile showed a lipid composition similar to that of healthy subjects with a restoration of the values of free cholesterol, lysoPC, SM, and PC only in group 2 of patients after treatment with RA. Conclusion. These data suggest that lipidomic and/or oxidative status of serum from patients with NASH could be useful as prognostic markers of response to an antioxidant treatment. Chondrocytes are one of the main cell types involved in rheumatoid inflammation, releasing mediators which add to cartilage destruction, bone damage and consequently disability. Current evidence suggests that serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists (5-HT(3)RA) show anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in vitro and in vivo. Yet, the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of 5-HT(3)RA have not been elucidated in detail. Therefore, we examined in detail the effects of 5-HT(3)RA on inflammatory parameters in human primary chondrocytes in vitro by studying prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 8-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF2Î±) levels by EIA and interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis by ELISA. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. We found a significant reduction of IL-1Î² induced PGE2, 8-iso-PGF2Î² and IL-6 chondrocytes by 5-HT(3)RA especially by dolasetron. This study provides additional support to the potential use of 5-HT(3)RAs as therapeutic agents to reduce joint inflammation. Methotrexate (MTX), the most used drug in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, showing variability in clinical response, is often associated with genetic polymorphisms. This study aimed to elucidate the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aminoimidazole carboxamide adenosine ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) T675C polymorphisms and clinicopathological variables in clinical response to MTX in Portuguese RA patients. Study included 233 RA patients treated with MTX for at least six months. MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C polymorphisms were genotyped and clinicopathological variables were collected. Statistical analyses were performed and binary logistic regression method adjusted to possible confounding variables. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that MTHFR 677TT (OR = 4.63; P = 0.013) and ATIC 675T carriers (OR = 5.16; P = 0.013) were associated with over 4-fold increased risk for nonresponse. For clinicopathological variables, noncurrent smokers (OR = 7.98; P = 0.001), patients positive to anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (OR = 3.53; P = 0.004) and antinuclear antibodies (OR = 2.28; P = 0.045), with higher health assessment questionnaire score (OR = 2.42; P = 0.007), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users (OR = 2.77; P = 0.018) were also associated with nonresponse. Contrarily, subcutaneous administration route (OR = 0.11; P < 0.001) was associated with response. Our study suggests that MTHFR C677T and ATIC T675C genotyping combined with clinicopathological data may help to identify patients whom will not benefit from MTX treatment and, therefore, assist clinicians in personalizing RA treatment. Long standing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with testicular dysfunction and subfertility. Few studies have addressed the pathogenesis of testicular injury in RA and its modulation by effective agents. Thus, the current study aimed at evaluating the effects of two testosterone boosting agents; chrysin, a natural flavone and celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in testicular impairment in rats with adjuvant arthritis, an experimental model of RA. Chrysin (25 and 50mg/kg) and celecoxib (5mg/kg) were orally administered to Wistar rats once daily for 21days starting 1h before arthritis induction. Chrysin suppressed paw edema with comparable efficacy to celecoxib. More important, chrysin, dose-dependently and celecoxib attenuated the testicular injury via reversing lowered gonadosomatic index and histopathologic alterations with preservation of spermatogenesis. Both agents upregulated steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) mRNA expression and serum testosterone with concomitant restoration of LH and FSH. Furthermore, they suppressed inflammation via abrogation of myeloperoxidase, TNF-Î± and protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS besides elevation of IL-10. Alleviation of the testicular impairment was accompanied with suppression of oxidative stress via lowering testicular lipid peroxides and nitric oxide. With respect to apoptosis, both agents downregulated FasL mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity in favor of cell survival. For the first time, these findings highlight the protective effects of chrysin and celecoxib against testicular dysfunction in experimental RA which were mediated via boosting testosterone in addition to attenuation of testicular inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Generally, the 50mg/kg dose of chrysin exerted comparable protective actions to celecoxib. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been implicated in a number of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the underlying signaling pathways triggering enhanced NETosis in RA and ascertained whether the products of NETosis had diagnostic implications or usefulness. Neutrophils were isolated from RA patients with active disease and from controls. Spontaneous NET formation from RA and control neutrophils was assessed in vitro with microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for NETosis-derived products. The analysis of the signal-transduction cascade included reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), and citrullinated histone 3 (citH3). NET formation was studied in response to serum and synovial fluid and immunoglobulin G (IgG) depleted and reconstituted serum. Serum was analyzed for NETosis-derived products, for which receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. Neutrophils from RA cases exhibited increased spontaneous NET formation in vitro, associated with elevated ROS production, enhanced NE and MPO expression, nuclear translocation of PAD4, PAD4-mediated citrullination of H3, and altered nuclear morphology. NET formation in both anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive and -negative RA was abolished by IgG depletion, but restored only with ACPA-positive IgG. NETosis-derived products in RA serum demonstrated diagnostic potential, the ROC area under the curve for cell-free nucleosomes being >97%, with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 92%. No significant difference was observed between ACPA-positive and -negative cases. Signaling elements associated with the extrusion of NETs are significantly enhanced to promote NETosis in RA compared with healthy controls. NETosis depended on the presence of ACPA in ACPA-positive RA serum. The quantitation of NETosis-derived products, such as cell-free nucleosomes in serum, may be a useful complementary tool to discriminate between healthy controls and RA cases. Spermatogenesis is a multistep synchronized process. Diploid spermatogonia differentiate into haploid spermatozoa following mitosis, meiosis and spermiogenesis. Division and differentiation of male germ cells is achieved through the sequential expression of several genes. Numerous mRNAs in the differentiating germ cells undergo post-transcriptional and translational regulation. MiRNAs are powerful negative regulators of mRNA transcription, stability, and translation and recognize their mRNA targets through base-pairing. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is essential for spermatogenesis and testicular function. Testicular RA level is critical for RA signal transduction. This study investigated the miRNAs modulation in an RA- induced testicular environment following the administration of all-trans RA (2 ÂµM) and CYP26B1- inhibitor (1 ÂµM) compared to control. Eighty four canine mature miRNAs were analyzed and their expression signatures were distinguished using real-time PCR based array technology. Of the miRNAs analyzed, miRNA families such as miR-200 (cfa-miR-200a, cfa-miR-200b and cfa-miR-200c), Mirlet-7 (cfa-let-7a, cfa-let-7b, cfa-let-7c, cfa-let-7g and cfa-let-7f), miR-125 (cfa-miR-125a and cfa-miR-125b), miR-146 (cfa-miR-146a and cfa-miR-146b), miR-34 (cfa-miR-34a, cfa-miR-34b and cfa-miR-34c), miR-23 (cfa-miR-23a and cfa-miR-23b), cfa-miR-184, cfa-miR-214 and cfa-miR-141 were significantly up-regulated with testicular RA intervention via administration of CYP26B1 inhibitor and all-trans-RA and species of miRNA such as cfa-miR-19a, cfa-miR-29b, cfa-miR-29c, cfa-miR-101 and cfa-miR-137 were significantly down-regulated. This study explored information regarding chromosome distribution, human orthologous sequences and the interaction of target genes of miRNA families significantly distinguished in this study using prediction algorithms. This study importantly identified dysregulated miRNA species resulting from RA-induced spermatogenesis. The present contribution serves as a useful resource for further elucidation of the regulatory role of individual miRNA in RA synchronized canine spermatogenesis. Functionally impaired Treg cells expressing abnormally low levels of CTLA-4 have been well documented in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular defect underlying this reduced expression is unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the role of DNA methylation in regulating CTLA-4 expression in Treg cells isolated from RA patients and to elucidate the mechanism of their reduced suppressor function. CTLA-4 expression in Treg cells from RA patients and healthy controls was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Methylation of the CTLA-4 gene promoter was analyzed by bisulfite-specific PCR, followed by sequencing. Methylation-dependent transcriptional activity of the CTLA-4 gene promoter was measured by luciferase assay, and NF-AT binding to the CTLA-4 gene promoter was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The role of CTLA-4 expression in controlling Teff cells was analyzed using an autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. Down-regulation of CTLA-4 expression in Treg cells from RA patients was caused by methylation of a previously unidentified NF-AT binding site within the CTLA-4 gene promoter. As a consequence, Treg cells were unable to induce expression and activation of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which in turn resulted in a failure to activate the immunomodulatory kynurenine pathway. We show for the first time that epigenetic modifications contribute to defective Treg cell function in RA through an inability to activate the IDO pathway. Therefore, this study sets a precedent for investigating potential therapeutic strategies aimed at reinforcing the IDO pathway in RA patients. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induce a broad spectrum of biochemical and toxic effects in mammals including alterations of the vital retinoid (vitamin A) system. The aim of this study was to characterize alterations of tissue retinoid levels in rat offspring and their dams following gestational and lactational exposure to the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (A1254) and to assess the interrelationship of these changes with other established sensitive biochemical and toxicological endpoints. Sprague-Dawley rat dams were exposed orally to 0 or 15 mg/kg body weight/day of A1254 from gestational day 1 to postnatal day (PND) 23. Livers, kidneys and serum were collected from the offspring on PNDs 35, 77 and 350. Tissue and serum retinoid levels, hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and serum thyroid hormones were analyzed. A multivariate regression between A1254 treatment, hepatic retinoid levels, hepatic CYP enzymes activities, thyroid hormone levels and body/liver weights was performed using an orthogonal partial least-squares (PLS) analysis. The contribution of dioxin-like (DL) components of A1254 to the observed effects was also estimated using the toxic equivalency (TEQ) concept. In both male and female offspring short-term alterations in tissue retinoid levels occurred at PND35, i.e. decreased levels of hepatic retinol and retinoic acid (RA) metabolite 9-cis-4-oxo-13,14-dihydro-RA with concurrent increases in hepatic and renal all-trans-RA levels. Long-term changes consisted of decreased hepatic retinyl palmitate and increased renal retinol levels that were apparent until PND350. Retinoid system alterations were associated with altered CYP enzyme activities and serum thyroid hormone levels as well as body and liver weights in both offspring and dams. The estimated DL activity was within an order of magnitude of the theoretical TEQ for different endpoints, indicating significant involvement of DL congeners in the observed effects. This study shows that tissue retinoid levels are affected both short- and long-term by developmental A1254 exposure and are associated with alterations of other established endpoints of toxicological concern. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) plays a critical role in sleep breathing disorder-associated hippocampus impairments, including neurocognitive deficits, irreversible memory and learning impairments. IH-induced neuronal injury in the hippocampus may result from reduced precursor cell proliferation and the relative numbers of postmitotic differentiated neurons. However, the mechanisms underlying IH-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation effects on cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation remain largely unknown. ROS generation significantly increased after 1-4 days of IH without increased pheochromocytoma-12 (PC12) cell death, which resulted in increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) mRNA and protein levels. After 3-4 days of IH, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) protein phosphorylation decreased, which could be reversed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), 1,10-phenanthroline (Phe), the PP2A phosphorylation inhibitors, okadaic acid (OKA) and cantharidin, and the ERK phosphorylation activator nicotine (p < 0.05). In particular, the significantly reduced cell proliferation and increased proportions of cells in the G0/G1 phase after 1-4 days of IH (p < 0.05), which resulted in decreased numbers of PC12 cells, could be reversed by treatment with SOD, Phe, PP2A inhibitors and an ERK activator. In addition, the numbers of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced PC12 cells with neurite outgrowths after 3-4 days of IH were less than those after 4 days of RA, which was also reversed by SOD, Phe, PP2A inhibitors and an ERK activator. Our results suggest that IH-induced ROS generation increases PP2A activation and subsequently downregulates ERK1/2 activation, which results in inhibition of PC12 cell proliferation through G0/G1 phase arrest and NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. High temperature will cause animal tissues or cells damage. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a good antioxidant and health care product, but the roles of RA in muscle cells damage and the mechanisms which caused by high temperature is still unknown. In this study, the roles of RA on hyperthermia-induced apoptosis and damage of C2C12 muscle cells were investigated. C2C12 cells were cultured in medium with different concentration (0, 25, 50, 100 ÂµM) RA and treated in 42 Â°C high temperature to induce cellular apoptosis and damage. Then, these cells were analyzed effect of different dose of RA on cells apoptosis and damage. The results indicated that RA has protective effect on heat-stress induced cellular damage, and the cells have the higher cell viability at the dose of 50 ÂµM RA by MTT assay. Hochest33342/PI double staining showed that the cellular apoptosis of C2C12 cells were decreased in the presence of selected 50 ÂµM RA. Malondialdehyde formation and reactive oxygen species levels were also decreased significantly, but cellular superoxide dismutase activity was increased significantly in the presence of RA even in the condition of 42 Â°C. Meanwhile, Caspase-3 mRNA expression, Caspase-3 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were reduced significantly, but the mRNA expression of Hsp72 was increased significantly in those hyperthermia-induced C2C12 cells in the presence of 50 ÂµM RA. Taken together, the results at least discovered that RA has protective effects on hyperthermia-induced cellular apoptosis and damage of muscle cells by change the expression of stress-genes and increasing intracellular antioxidant capability. To investigate the potential protective effects of Rosmarinic acid (RA) on rats exposed to ischaemia/reperfusion renal injury. The prospective study was conducted at Abant Izzet Baysal University, Turkey, and comprised 21 male Spraque Dawley rats weighing 250-270g each. They were divided into three equal groups. Unilaterally nephrectomised rats were subjected to 60 minutes of left renal ischaemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Group 1 had sham-operated animals; group 2 had ischaemia/reperfusion untreated animals; and group 3 had ischaemia/reperfusion animals treated with rosmarinic acid. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, tissue malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and light microscopic findings were evaluated. SPSS 17 was used for statistical analysis. Treatment of rats with rosmarinic acid produced a reduction in the serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen compared to the other groups. However, no statistically significant difference was found. The levels of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase were decreased in the renal tissue of group 3, while glutathione peroxidose and superoxide dismutase levels remained unchanged. The injury score decreased in the treatment group rats compared to the untreated group. Rosmarinic acid significantly decreased focal glomerular necrosis, dilatation of Bowman's capsule, degeneration of tubular epithelium, necrosis in tubular epithelium, and tubular dilatation. Rosmarinic acid prevented ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the kidneys by decreasing oxidative stress. Skeletal muscle weakness is a prominent clinical feature in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the underlying mechanism(s) is unknown. Here we investigate the mechanisms behind arthritis-induced skeletal muscle weakness with special focus on the role of nitrosative stress on intracellular Ca(2+) handling and specific force production. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, degree of nitrosative stress and composition of the major intracellular Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor 1, RyR1) complex were measured in muscle. Changes in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and force production were assessed in single-muscle fibres and isolated myofibrils using atomic force cantilevers. The total neuronal NOS (nNOS) levels were increased in muscles both from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and patients with RA. The nNOS associated with RyR1 was increased and accompanied by increased [Ca(2+)]i during contractions of muscles from CIA mice. A marker of peroxynitrite-derived nitrosative stress (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-NT) was increased on the RyR1 complex and on actin of muscles from CIA mice. Despite increased [Ca(2+)]i, individual CIA muscle fibres were weaker than in healthy controls, that is, force per cross-sectional area was decreased. Furthermore, force and kinetics were impaired in CIA myofibrils, hence actin and myosin showed decreased ability to interact, which could be a result of increased 3-NT content on actin. Arthritis-induced muscle weakness is linked to nitrosative modifications of the RyR1 protein complex and actin, which are driven by increased nNOS associated with RyR1 and progressively increasing Ca(2+) activation. Alismatis rhizome (RA) (Water Plantain Family, also called "Zexie" in Chinese), one of the commonly used components of traditional Chinese medicines, is derived from the dried rhizomes of Alisma orientalis (Sam.) Juzep. (Alismataceae). This study explores the RA influences on rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo. A cocktail solution at a dose of 5 mL/kg, which contained phenacetin (20 mg/kg), tolbutamide (5 mg/kg), chlorzoxazone (20 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg), was orally administration to rats treated twice daily with RA (10, 20 and 40 g/kg) for consecutive 14 days. Blood samples (0.2 mL) were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0 (Wenzhou Medical College, Zhejiang, China). In the experiment, there was a statistically significant difference in the t1/2, Cmax, AUC(0-â) and CL for phenacetin and midazolam, while there was no statistical pharmacokinetics difference for tolbutamide and chlorzoxazone. Our study showed that treatment with multiple doses of RA had an inductive effect on rat CYP1A2 and an inhibitory effect on rat CYP3A4 enzyme activity. However, RA has no inductive or inhibitory effect on the activities of CYP2C9 and CYP2E1. Caution is needed when RA is co-administration with some CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates in clinic, because it may result in treatment failure and herb-drug interactions. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a vitamin A metabolite that plays major roles in regulating stem cell differentiation and development. RA is the ligand of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family of transcription factors, which interact with retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) within target gene proximal promoters and enhancers. Although RA-mediated gene activation is well understood, less is known about the mechanisms for repression at RA-regulated genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that in embryonic stem cells in the absence of RA, histone deacetylases (HDACs) differentially bind to various RAREs in proximal promoters or enhancer regions of RA-regulated genes; HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 bind at RAREs in the Hoxa1 and Cyp26a1 gene regulatory regions, whereas only HDAC1 binds at the RARÎ²2 RARE. shRNA knockdown of HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 differentially increases the deposition of the histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) epigenetic mark associated with increases in these three transcripts. Importantly, RA treatment differentially mediates the removal of HDACs from the Hoxa1, Cyp26a1, and RARÎ²2 genes and promotes the deposition of the H3K27ac mark at these genes. Overall, we show that HDACs differentially bind to RA-regulated genes to control key epigenetic marks involved in stem cell differentiation. CYP26A1 expression is very highly induced by retinoic acid (RA) in the liver, compared to most other tissues, suggesting that a liver-enriched factor may be required for its physiological transcriptional response. HNF4Î± is a highly conserved liver-specific/enriched member of nuclear receptor superfamily. In this study, we hypothesized that HNF4Î± and RARs may cooperate in an RA-dependent manner to induce a high level of CYP26A1 expression in liver cells. Partial inhibition of endogenous HNF4Î± by siRNA reduced the level of RA-induced CYP26A1 mRNA in HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of HNF4Î±, with or without RARs, demonstrated RA-dependent activation of a human CYP26A1 promoter-luciferase construct. Analysis of a 2.5-kbp putative CYP26A1 promoter sequence identified five potential HNF4Î± DNA response elements: H1 located in a proximal region overlapping with an RAR element-1 (RARE1 or R1); H2 and H3 in the distal region, close to RARE2 (R2) and RARE3 (R3); and H4 and H5 in intermediary regions. In EMSA and ChIP analyses HNF4Î± and RARs binding in the proximal and distal CYP26A1 promoter regions was significantly higher in RA-treated cells. Mutational analysis of the individual HNF4Î± DNA-response elements identified H1 as the major site for HNF4Î± binding because mutation of H1 inhibited the promoter activity by ~90%, followed by H2 mutation with less than 40% inhibition. Our results indicate that HNF4Î± coordinates with RARs in an RA-dependent manner to strongly induce CYP26A1 gene expression in the liver, which may explain the high level of response to RA observed in vivo. All-trans retinoic acid (t-RA) is a natural component and representative physiologically active metabolite of vitamin A, having multiple physiologic functions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of t-RA on goat oocyte maturation and cumulus cell apoptosis during in vitro maturation (IVM). Immature goat cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in vitro in the absence or presence of t-RA at concentrations of 10ânmol/L, 100ânmol/L and 1000ânmol/L. Oocyte maturation and embryo development were assessed by polar body formation and parthenogenetic activation, respectively. Oocyte survival was checked by Trypan blue staining. Apoptosis of cumulus cells was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling staining and quantitative real-time PCR. In comparison with the control group, 100ânmol/L and 10ânmol/L t-RA significantly improved goat nuclear oocyte maturation and survival (Pâ<â0.05). Addition of 1000ânmol/L t-RA improved nuclear maturation (Pâ<â0.05), but had no effect on survival of goat oocytes. t-RA had no positive effect on goat parthenogenetic embryonic cleavage, blastocyst formation or total cell numbers. However, t-RA inhibits the apoptosis of cumulus cells (Pâ<â0.01). t-RA treatment up-regulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), catalase (CAT) (Pâ<â0.05) and down-regulated the expression of Caspase-8 (Pâ<â0.05). In conclusion, t-RA has positive effects on goat oocyte nuclear maturation and reduces apoptotic cumulus cells during IVM. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease with no known cure. Current strategies to treat RA, including methotrexate (MTX), target the later inflammatory stage of disease. Recently, we showed that inhibiting indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) with 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT) targets autoantibodies and cytokines that drive the initiation of the autoimmune response. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining 1MT with MTX would target both the initiation and chronic inflammatory phases of the autoimmune response and be an effective co-therapeutic strategy for arthritis. To test this, we used K/BxN mice, a pre-clinical model of arthritis that develops joint-specific inflammation with many characteristics of human RA. Mice were treated with 1MT, MTX, alone or in combination, and followed for arthritis, autoantibodies, and inflammatory cytokines. Both 1MT and MTX were able to partially inhibit arthritis when used individually; however, combining MTXâ+â1MT was significantly more effective than either treatment alone at delaying the onset and alleviating the severity of joint inflammation. We went on to show that combination of MTXâ+â1MT did not lower inflammatory cytokine or autoantibody levels, nor could the synergistic co-therapeutic effect be reversed by the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline or be mimicked by inhibition of polyamine synthesis. However, supplementation with folinic acid did reverse the synergistic co-therapeutic effect, demonstrating that, in the K/BxN model, MTX synergizes with 1MT by blocking folate metabolism. These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of IDO with 1MT is a potential candidate for use in combination with MTX to increase its efficacy in the treatment of RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients usually exhibit immune complex (IC) deposition and increased neutrophil activation in the joint. In this study, we assessed how four flavonols (galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin) modulate the effector functions of healthy individuals' and active RA patients' IC-stimulated neutrophils. We measured superoxide anion and total reactive oxygen species production using lucigenin (CL-luc)- and luminol (CL-lum)-enhanced chemiluminescence assays, respectively. Galangin, kaempferol, and quercetin inhibited CL-lum to the same degree (mean IC50=2.5 Î¼M). At 2.5 Î¼M, quercetin and galangin suppressed nearly 65% CL-lum of active RA patients' neutrophils. Quercetin inhibited CL-luc the most effectively (IC50=1.71Â±0.36 Î¼M). The four flavonols diminished myeloperoxidase activity, but they did not decrease NADPH oxidase activity, phagocytosis, microbial killing, or cell viability of neutrophils. The ability of the flavonols to scavenge hypochlorous acid and chloramines, but not H2O2, depended on the hydroxylation degree of the flavonol B-ring. Therefore, at physiologically relevant concentrations, the flavonols partially inhibited the oxidative metabolism of IC-stimulated neutrophils without affecting the other investigated effector functions. Using these compounds to modulate IC-mediated neutrophil activation is a promising safe therapeutic strategy to control inflammation in active RA patients. It is well established that environmental influences play a key role in sculpting neuronal connectivity in the brain. One example is the olfactory sensory map of topographic axonal connectivity. While intrinsic odorant receptor signaling in olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) determines anterior-posterior counter gradients of the axonal guidance receptors Neuropilin-1 and Plexin-A1, little is known about stimulus-dependent gradients of protein expression, which correlates with the functional organization of the olfactory sensory map along its dorsomedial (DM)-ventrolateral (VL) axis. Deficiency of the Alzheimer's Î²-secretase BACE1, which is expressed in a DM(low)-VL(high) gradient, results in OSN axon targeting errors in a DM > VL and gene dose-dependent manner. We show that expression of BACE1 and the all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme Cyp26B1 form DM-VL counter gradients in the olfactory epithelium. Analyses of mRNA and protein levels in OSNs after naris occlusion, in mice deficient in the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and in relation to onset of respiration, show that BACE1 and Cyp26B1 expression in OSNs inversely depend on neuronal activity. Overexpression of a Cyp26B1 or presence of a dominant negative RA receptor transgene selectively in OSNs, inhibit BACE1 expression while leaving the DM(low)-VL(high) gradient of the axonal guidance protein Neuropilin-2 intact. We conclude that stimulus-dependent neuronal activity can control the expression of the RA catabolic enzyme Cyp26B1 and downstream genes such as BACE1. This result is pertinent to an understanding of the mechanisms by which a topographic pattern of connectivity is achieved and modified as a consequence of graded gene expression and sensory experience. The aim of this study was to explore whether the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) play a role in methotrexate (MTX) toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MEDLINE and EMBASE database searches and subsequent manual searches were utilized to identify articles in which C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms were evaluated in RA patients taking MTX. A meta-analysis was conducted to identify associations between MTHFR polymorphisms and MTX toxicity. Twelve studies comprising a total of 2,288 RA patients were included in our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed an association between the overall toxicity of MTX and the MTHFR 677TT genotype (odds ratio [OR]â=â1.615, 95 % confidence interval [CI]â=â1.185-2.200, pâ=â0.002). Stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the MTHFR 677TT genotype and the overall toxicity of MTX in East Asians (ORâ=â1.583, 95 % CIâ=â1.075-2.331, pâ=â0.020). The toxicity of MTX also was found to be associated with the TT genotype in patients taking folate (ORâ=â1.893, 95 % CIâ=â1.283-2.793, pâ=â0.001). Stratification by toxicity type indicated an association between the MTHFR 677TT genotype and any adverse effects (ORâ=â1.716, 95 % CIâ=â1.127-2.612, pâ=â0.012). Meta-analysis stratified by toxicity type indicated an association between the MTHFR 1298CC genotype and any adverse effects (ORâ=â0.501, 95 % CIâ=â0.284-0.886, pâ=â0.017). The results of our meta-analysis suggest that the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are associated with MTX toxicity in RA patients. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are a major source of the immunoregulatory metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which may contribute to the generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) in the liver. The present study seeks to clarify the mechanism(s) through which ATRA promotes the development of tolerogenic DCs. Although bone marrow-derived ATRA-treated DCs (RA-DCs) and conventional DCs had comparable surface phenotype, RA-DCs had diminished stimulatory capacity and could directly inhibit the expansion of DC/OVA-stimulated OT-II T cells. Arginase-1 (Arg-1) was found promote suppression because 1) ATRA was a potent inducer of Arg-1 protein and activity, 2) the Arg-1 inhibitor N(w)-hydroxy nor-l-arginine partially reversed suppression, and 3) the suppressive function of RA-DCs was partially compromised using OT-II T cells from GCN2(-/-) mice, which are insensitive to Arg-1. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS), however, was found to be a more significant contributor to RA-DC function because 1) ATRA potentiated the expression of IFN-Î³-induced iNOS, 2) suppressive function in RA-DCs was blocked by the iNOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine, monoacetate salt, and 3) RA-DCs derived from iNOS(-/-) mice exhibited near complete loss of tolerogenic function, despite sustained Arg-1 activity. The expression of iNOS and the suppressive function of RA-DCs were dependent on both IFN-Î³ and ATRA. Furthermore, the in vivo behavior of RA-DCs proved to be consistent with their in vitro behavior. Thus, we conclude that ATRA enhances both Arg-1 and iNOS expression in IFN-Î³-treated DCs, resulting in a tolerogenic phenotype. These findings elucidate mechanisms through which ATRA may contribute to liver immune tolerance. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is implicated as a local mediator of tissue damage when released extracellularly in many chronic inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of endogenous MPO in experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA). K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and MPO knockout (MPO(-/-) ) mice, and disease development was assessed. MPO activity was measured in joint tissues from mice with or without K/BxN arthritis. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in WT and MPO(-/-) mice, and disease development and immune responses were examined. MPO expression was assessed in synovial biopsy samples from patients with active RA, and the effect of MPO on synovial fibroblasts was tested in vitro. MPO was up-regulated in the joints of mice with K/BxN arthritis, and MPO deficiency attenuated the severity of the disease without affecting circulating cytokine levels. In CIA, MPO(-/-) mice had enhanced CD4+ T cell responses and reduced frequency of regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes and spleen, as well as augmented interleukin-17A and diminished interferon-Î³ secretion by collagen-stimulated splenocytes, without an effect on circulating anticollagen antibody levels. Despite enhanced adaptive immunity in secondary lymphoid organs, CIA development was attenuated in MPO(-/-) mice. Intracellular and extracellular MPO was detected in the synovium of patients with active RA, and human MPO enhanced the proliferation and decreased the apoptosis of synovial fibroblasts in vitro. MPO contributes to the development of arthritis despite suppressing adaptive immunity in secondary lymphoid organs. This suggests distinct effects of local MPO on arthritogenic effector responses. Rebamipide, a gastroprotective agent, has the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen radicals. Increased oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We undertook this study to investigate the impact of rebamipide on the development of arthritis and the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which rebamipide attenuates arthritis severity in a murine model of RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in DBA/1J mice. Anti-type II collagen antibody titers and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of transcription factors was analyzed by immunostaining and Western blotting. Frequencies of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (Th17 cells) and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Rebamipide reduced the clinical arthritis score and severity of histologic inflammation and cartilage destruction in a dose-dependent manner. The joints isolated from rebamipide-treated mice with CIA showed decreased expression of nitrotyrosine, an oxidative stress marker. Rebamipide-treated mice showed lower circulating levels of type II collagen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a. Whereas the number of Th17 cells in spleens was decreased in rebamipide-treated mice with CIA, a significant increase in the number of Treg cells in spleens was observed. In vitro, rebamipide inhibited Th17 cell differentiation through STAT-3/retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor Î³t and reciprocally induced Treg cell differentiation through FoxP3. Rebamipide increased Nrf2 nuclear activities in murine CD4+ T cells and LBRM-33 murine T lymphoma cells. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression in the spleens was markedly increased in rebamipide-treated mice. The inhibitory effects of rebamipide on joint inflammation are associated with recovery from an imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells and with activation of an Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway. Eccentric exercise is known to disrupt sarcolemmal integrity and induce damage of skeletal muscle fibers. We hypothesized that L-arginine (L-Arg; nitric oxide synthase (NOS) substrate) supplementation prior to a single bout of eccentric exercise would diminish exercise-induced damage. In addition, we used N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME; NOS inhibitor) to clarify the role of native NOS activity in the development of exercise-induced muscle damage. Rats were divided into four groups: non-treated control (C), downhill running with (RA) or without (R) L-Arg supplementation and downhill running with L-NAME supplementation (RN). Twenty four hours following eccentric exercise seven rats in each group were sacrificed and soleus muscles were dissected and frozen for further analysis. The remaining seven rats in each group were subjected to the exercise performance test. Our experiments showed that L-Arg supplementation prior to a single bout of eccentric exercise improved subsequent exercise performance capacity tests in RA rats when compared with R, RN and C rats by 37%, 27% and 13%, respectively. This outcome is mediated by L-Arg protection against post-exercise damage of sarcolemma (2.26- and 0.87-fold less than R and RN groups, respectively), reduced numbers of damaged muscle fibers indicated by the reduced loss of desmin content in the muscle (15% and 25% less than R and RN groups, respectively), and diminished Âµ-calpain mRNA up-regulation (42% and 30% less than R and RN groups, respectively). In conclusion, our study indicates that L-Arg supplementation prior to a single bout of eccentric exercise alleviates muscle fiber damage and preserves exercise performance capacity. For decades, retinoic acid (RA) is known as the most potent therapeutic option in the therapy of acne and altered homeostasis of endogenous retinoids has been discussed in the context of acne pathogenesis. Besides retinoids, antibiotics such as tetracyclines or erythromycin are well established in acne pharmacotherapy. Accumulating evidence points towards common molecular pathways being targeted by both RA and anti-acne antibiotics; however, a precise 'common denominator' connecting these chemically diverse anti-acne agents has not yet been identified. Interestingly, tetracyclines are associated with the occurrence of pseudotumor cerebri, a rare neurological side effect otherwise associated with retinoid intoxication or RA exposure. This association at the clinical level suggests an interaction between tetracyclines and endogenous RA signalling. As erythromycin does not cross the blood brain barrier, CNS side effects are not to be expected, yet not precluding a possible local interaction of erythromycin with endogenous RA metabolism in the skin. We hypothesize tetracyclines and erythromycin to locally inhibit endogenous RA metabolism in the skin and thus mimic therapeutic action of RA. This readily testable hypothesis suggests inhibition of endogenous RA metabolism and amplification of endogenous RA signalling as a mechanism underlying the biochemical actions of antibiotics in acne therapy. Elucidation of such interactions may ultimately enhance our understanding of acne therapy and pathogenesis and may yield a sound, scientific basis for hypothesis-driven development of novel therapeutic compounds. Sex hormones play an active role in inflammatory responses, with androgens being anti-inflammatory, whereas estrogens have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, low levels of androgens and high levels of estrone are found in the synovial fluid. Aromatase is the key enzyme for the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Proinflammatory cytokines stimulate aromatase activity so that the inflammatory milieu can induce conversion of androgens to estrogens. Moreover, testosterone inhibits aromatase activity. As local androgen levels are low in RA, this can contribute to high aromatase activity in the synovium. Importantly, aromatase-converted estrogens are converted into proproliferative and proinflammatory 16-hydroxylated estrogens. A hormone involved in aromatase activity is vitamin D, which downregulates aromatase in human RA macrophages. Collectively, evidence suggests a key role of aromatase in sex hormone balance during chronic inflammation and points to the importance of vitamin D as a possible new tool for aromatase modulation. During embryonic and early postnatal development, retinoic acid (RA) regulates genes that control neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth from the neural tube. The effects of high levels of RA on the CNS can be detected via nitric oxide (NO), which plays a crucial role in neural transmission. The aim of the study was to investigate the prenatal influence of high levels of RA on postnatal development of nitrergic structures in lumbar spinal cord and antioxidant status. RA was administered orally at a dose of 10mg/kg body weight to pregnant female Wistar rats during days 8-10 of gestation. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) of lumbar spinal cord sections was processed for visualization via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry on postnatal day one, day twenty-one and in adults. The results suggest that prenatal administration of high levels of RA is not associated with postnatal morphological changes in nNOS-positive neurons in the rat lumbar spinal cord. An estimation of the activity of enzymes related to the storage of retinoid in the liver showed possible side effects. Suppression and deepening of superoxide dismutase activity persisted into adulthood, and a concurrent downregulation of glutathione reductase was noted. A decrease in reduced glutathione persisted until adulthood when other compensatory mechanisms were probably active to maintain an appropriate level. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common chronic respiratory disease that occurs after premature birth, is believed to be secondary to oxidative damage from hyperoxia and inflammation, which leads to impaired alveolar formation and chronic lung dysfunction. We hypothesized that extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD)3, an antioxidant uniquely targeted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and alveolar fluid, might have a different response (down-regulation) to hyperoxic injury and recovery in room air (RA), thereby contributing to the persistent airspace injury and inflammation. We used a murine BPD model using postnatal hyperoxia (O2) (4 or 5 d) followed by short-term recovery (14 d) in RA, which mimics the durable effects after injury during alveolar development. This was associated with significantly increased mRNA expression for antioxidant genes mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) in the O2 (n = 4) versus RA group (n = 5). SOD3, an Nrf2-independent antioxidant, was significantly reduced in the O2-exposed mice compared with RA. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased and disrupted SOD3 deposition in the alveolar ECM of O2-exposed mice. Furthermore, this distinct hyperoxic antioxidant and injury profile was reproducible in murine lung epithelial 12 cells exposed to O2. Overexpression of SOD3 rescued the injury measures in the O2-exposed cells. We establish that reduced SOD3 expression correlates with alveolar injury measures in the recovered neonatal hyperoxic lung, and SOD3 overexpression attenuates hyperoxic injury in an alveolar epithelial cell line. Such findings suggest a candidate mechanism for the pathogenesis of BPD that may lead to targeted interventions. CYP1A1, a P450 isoenzyme, is involved in the phase I xenobiotic metabolism including teratogen drugs. In the present study, the ability of teratogens to elevate the embryonic expression of CYP1A1 was examined. Micromass cell cultures prepared from day 13 rat embryo limb buds (LB). LB cells were cultivated and exposed for 5 days to retinoic acid (RA), hydrocortisone (HC), caffeine (CA) and quinine (QN). CYP1A1 protein expression and activity were measured using immunofluorescence staining and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) assay, respectively. The EROD activity increased significantly following LB cells exposure to RA and HC (p<0.05) but the expression of CYP1A1 protein was reduced by these drugs, whereas the expression of CYP1A1 protein and EROD activity decreased significantly following the addition of CA and QN (p<0.05, p<0.01). Our findings show that studied teratogens have potency to increase CYP1A1 activity. Normal heart development requires appropriate levels of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. RA levels in embryos are dampened by Cyp26 enzymes, which metabolize RA into easily degraded derivatives. Loss of Cyp26 function in humans is associated with numerous developmental syndromes that include cardiovascular defects. Although previous studies have shown that Cyp26-deficient vertebrate models also have cardiovascular defects, the mechanisms underlying these defects are not understood. Here, we found that in zebrafish, two Cyp26 enzymes, Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1, are expressed in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) and predominantly overlap with vascular progenitors (VPs). Although singular knockdown of Cyp26a1 or Cyp26c1 does not overtly affect cardiovascular development, double Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1 (referred to here as Cyp26)-deficient embryos have increased atrial cells and reduced cranial vasculature cells. Examining the ALPM using lineage tracing indicated that in Cyp26-deficient embryos the myocardial progenitor field contains excess atrial progenitors and is shifted anteriorly into a region that normally solely gives rise to VPs. Although Cyp26 expression partially overlaps with VPs in the ALPM, we found that Cyp26 enzymes largely act cell non-autonomously to promote appropriate cardiovascular development. Our results suggest that localized expression of Cyp26 enzymes cell non-autonomously defines the boundaries between the cardiac and VP fields within the ALPM through regulating RA levels, which ensures a proper balance of myocardial and endothelial lineages. Our study provides novel insight into the earliest consequences of Cyp26 deficiency that underlie cardiovascular malformations in vertebrate embryos. Palatogenesis involves various developmental events such as growth, elevation, elongation and fusion of opposing palatal shelves. Extrinsic factors such as mouth opening and subsequent tongue withdrawal are also needed for the horizontal elevation of palate shelves. Failure of any of these steps can lead to cleft palate, one of the most common birth defects in humans. It has been shown that retinoic acid (RA) plays important roles during palate development, but excess RA causes cleft palate in fetuses of both rodents and humans. Thus, the coordinated regulation of retinoid metabolism is essential for normal palatogenesis. The endogenous RA level is determined by the balance of RA-synthesizing (retinaldehyde dehydrogenases: RALDHs) and RA-degrading enzymes (CYP26s). Cyp26b1 is a key player in normal palatogenesis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the study of the pathogenesis of RA-induced cleft palate, with special reference to the regulation of endogenous RA levels by RA-degrading enzymes. Shen Fu Injection (SF), which consisted of Red ginseng extraction injection (RG) and prepared aconite extraction injection (RA), is a traditional Chinese medicine mainly used for various cardiac diseases. This study is to analyse SF's effects on cardiac performance and coronary circulation. And the coronary dilating effect and mechanism of the above three injections were also explored. Mature male guinea pigs were used as our animal model. We employed two types of perfusion methods (constant pressure and constant flow) in vitro, using Langendorff heart preparations to observe the cardiac function and coronary response to SF (1/200). The coronary dilation effects of the above three injections (1/800, 1/400 and 1/200) were recorded at basal coronary resting tone and when coronary vessels were pre-contracted with a thromboxane A2 analogue (U46619), in the presence or the absence of the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis (L-NAME, 10-4 M), the blocker of Ca2+-activated potassium channel(TEA, 10-3 M), or the blocker of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (glybenclamide) (10-5 M). When perfused with constant pressure, SF significantly increased coronary flow, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and the rate-pressure product (RPP). When perfused with constant flow, SF produced a significant reduction in the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), LVDP and RPP. The coronary vasodilatation response of the above three injections can be reduced by L-NAME but was unaffected by TEA or glybenclamide when coronary vessels were pre-contracted with U46619 but not at resting tone. SF, RG and RA can all up-regulate eNOS expression in the human umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926). We demonstrated that SF does not contribute to the inotropic change of myocardium whose improvement is due to alternation of coronary flow. The coronary dilation effect of SF was mediated through RG and RA, via promoting NO release. DiHydroOrotate DeHydrogenase [huDHODH] is a therapeutic target for Rheumatoid arthritis [RA]. Leflunomide [A771726] is a widely used synthetic inhibitor against huDHODH. We to find more efficient lead like compounds. A four featured E-Pharmacophore A1D4H6R7 was built based on the inhibitor A771726. This pharmacophore was validated by checking its ability to identify known highly active inhibitors of huDHODH and assigning higher fitness scores to them. A reverse validation was also performed where random 4 featured pharmacophores were built and its efficiency in identifying actives was compared with our E-Pharmacophore. Our Epharmacophore was very efficient, since it passed both validations by picking the known active molecules with high fitness scores. This validated E- pharmacophore was searched against the KEGG phytochemicals subset database. This search resulted in 18 molecules which were subjected to docking with huDHODH. The molecules with docking score greater than that of A771726 were selected. The docking results were further validated using MM/GBSA which gave similar ranking with high binding free energy values. The four molecules 6-Methoxytaxifolin, Rhamnetin, Rhamnazin and Pinoquercetin were taken for explicit 3ns simulation and it was observed that all four molecules had acceptable RMSD values and stable interactions. Thus our study, suggests four phytomolecules that might inhibit huDHODH more efficiently than A771726. Interestingly, some of the obtained hits have already been proven in vitro anti-inflammatory activity which confirms that, the developed E-pharmacophore can be used to identify novel small molecules against inflammatory target, huDHODH. Sour cherry seed extract (SCE) was evaluated for its capacity to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-treated human peripheral blood T cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the chemokine interleukin-8. Both proteins are diagnostic biomarkers for inflammatory pathologies. Peripheral blood leukocytes from 11 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 8 healthy control subjects were co-cultured for 24h in lipopolysaccharide and the extract, then evaluated by flow cytometry for T cell activation and by enzyme-linked immunoassay for lymphocyte-associated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. There was a dose-dependent decrease in expression of the immunophenotypes: CD3+TNF-Î±+, and CD3+IL8+ in cultures from RA patients to a greater extent than in cells from healthy participants. These results suggest that the extract may have a modulatory roll in RA and other inflammatory disorders via the induction of HO-1, thus abating oxidative stress and strengthening regulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. To date, functional MTHFR SNPs have been tested for their impact on low-dose methotrexate (MTX) response in small rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohorts. We sought to test their effect in the single largest cohort studied to date, and undertook a meta-analysis utilizing stringent study inclusion criteria. RA patients treated with MTX monotherapy from the Yorkshire Early Arthritis Register (YEAR) were genotyped using RFLP assays, and tested for association with treatment efficacy. Studies for meta-analysis were screened by a set of stringent inclusion criteria. rs1801131 and rs1801133 were not associated with response to MTX in the YEAR cohort, nor did they affect the probability of achieving a low disease activity state. A meta-analysis of comparable studies found no association with these SNPs. MTHFR SNPs rs1801131 and rs1801133 are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on the first 6 months of MTX treatment in early RA. NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in angiogenesis. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Of these, NOX1 and NOX2 have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform NOX4 in ECs contributed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase MRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ecs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR. Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model). NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from the RA-raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots. STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18. Semiquantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA. In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 and STAT3, and total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in western blot analyses. VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls. NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs. NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA. Compared to RA, the expression of retinal NOX4 increased at P18. At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups. In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation. VEGF induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-VEGFR2 and NOX4. Knockdown of NOX4: 1) reduced VEGFR2 activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished STAT3 activation in response to VEGF. Knockdown of either NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation. Our data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 was increased at a time point when IVNV developed. VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via activation of STAT3. Altogether, our results suggest that NOX4 may regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV through activated STAT3. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a critical epigenetic regulator in many biological processes, including maintenance of cell identity, stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, and deregulation of PRC2 is often observed in human cancers and diseases. Here we report that KDM5B (PLU-1/JARID1B), a histone lysine demethylase of Jumonji family, associates with PRC2 and colocalizes with PRC2 in nuclear bodies, and their physical association is dependent on direct interaction between KDM5B and the SUZ12 component of PRC2. Interestingly, co-occupancy of KDM5B and PRC2 was evidenced at the conserved cis-regulatory DNA element on retinoic acid (RA) responsive genes. Transcription readout and in vitro pull-down experiments suggest that KDM5B is an essential co-activator, but not a co-repressor, for the RA signaling, and the interface between KDM5B's JMJC domain and retinoic acid receptor Î± (RARÎ±) is crucial for RA-mediated gene expression. Detailed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays addressed the seemingly paradox by revealing a biphasic effect of KDM5B on RA-induced gene activation through decoupled H3K4me3 demethylation and PRC2-antagonizing activities. These results demonstrate that KDM5B and PRC2 regulate RA signaling cascade in a cooperative and orchestrated fashion. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inflammatory infiltration of the synovium and elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is involved in the development of inflammatory diseases. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of the study was to investigate the detailed mechanisms of TNF-Î±-induced cPLA2 expression and to determine whether carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CO-RM2) suppresses TNF-Î±-induced expression of NF-ÎºB-related proinflammatory genes, including cPLA2, via HO-1 induction in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Here, we reported that TNF-Î±-induced cPLA2 expression was mediated through TNFR1/PKCÎ±-dependent signaling pathways, including NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation/ROS production and NF-ÎºB activation. CO-RM2 significantly suppressed TNF-Î±-induced cPLA2 expression by inhibiting the ROS generation and the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB p65 and IKK Î±/Î², but not the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2. These results were further confirmed by a ChIP assay to detect the NF-ÎºB DNA-binding activity. Our results demonstrated that induction of HO-1 by CO-RM2 exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects which were required in concert to prevent the activation of NF-ÎºB leading to induction of various inflammatory genes implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The aim of this study was to assess the oxidative stress status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by measuring markers of free radical production, systemic activity of disease, and levels of antioxidant. 52 RA patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study, and clinical examination and investigations were performed and disease activity was assessed. Peripheral blood samples were used for all the assays. We assessed the markers of oxidative stress, including plasma levels of index of lipid peroxidation-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), hydrogen peroxide (HâOâ), superoxide anion radical (Oâ(-)), nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), catalase activity (CAT) and glutathione levels in erythrocytes. In the RA group, levels of HâOâ, Oâ(-), and TBARS were significantly higher than in controls (4.08 Â± 0.31 vs. 2.39 Â± 0.13 nmol/l, p < 0.01; 8.90 Â± 1.28 vs. 3.04 Â± 0.38 nmol/l, p < 0.01, 3.65 Â± 0.55 vs. 1.06 Â± 0.17 Î¼mol/l, p < 0.01). RA patients had significantly increased SOD activity compared with healthy controls (2,918.24 Â± 477.14 vs. 643.46 Â± 200.63UgHbx103, p < 0.001). Patients had significantly higher levels of pro-oxidants (Oâ(-), HâOâ, and TBARS) compared to controls, despite significantly higher levels of SOD. Significant differences were also observed in serum levels of NO in patients with high-diseases activity. Our findings support an association between oxidative/nitrosative stress and RA. Stronger response in samples with higher diseases activity suggests that oxidative/nitrosative stress markers may be useful in evaluating the progression of RA as well as in elucidating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. The aim of the study was to investigate any associations between benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene (FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqÎ±I loci) and the CYP17 gene (MspA1I locus), as well as TA repeat polymorphism in SRD5A2 gene among Lebanese men. DNA extracted from blood of 68 subjects with confirmed BPH and 79 age-matched controls was subjected to PCR/PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The odds ra=tio (OR) of having a genotype and the relative risk (RR) of developing BPH for having the genotype were calculated and the alleles were designated risk-bearing or protective. Our data indicated that the A and B alleles of the VDR ApaI and BsmI SNPs were highly associated with increased risk of BPH (p=0.0168 and 0.0002, respectively). Moreover, 63% of the controls compared to 43% of the subjects with BPH were homozygous for none of the risk-bearing alleles (p=0.0123) whereas 60% of the controls and 28% of the subjects with BPH were homozygous for two or more protective alleles (p<0.0001). For the first time, our study demonstrated that ApaI and BsmI of the VDR gene are associated with risk of BPH among Lebanese men. Our study also indicated that overall polymorphism profile of all the genes involved in prostate physiology could be a better predictor of BPH risk. Immortalized hepatocyte cell lines show only a weak resemblance to primary hepatocytes in terms of gene expression and function, limiting their value in predicting drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Furthermore, primary hepatocytes cultured on two-dimensional tissue culture plastic surfaces rapidly dedifferentiate losing their hepatocyte functions and metabolic competence. We have developed a three-dimensional in vitro model using extracellular matrix-based hydrogel for long-term culture of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. HepG2 cells cultured in this model stop proliferating, self-organize and differentiate to form multiple polarized spheroids. These spheroids re-acquire lost hepatocyte functions such as storage of glycogen, transport of bile salts and the formation of structures resembling bile canaliculi. HepG2 spheroids also show increased expression of albumin, urea, xenobiotic transcription factors, phase I and II drug metabolism enzymes and transporters. Consistent with this, cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is significantly higher in HepG2 spheroids compared to monolayer cultures. This highly differentiated phenotype can be maintained in 384-well microtiter plates for at least 28 days. Toxicity assessment studies with this model showed an increased sensitivity in identifying hepatotoxic compounds with repeated dosing regimens. This simple and robust high-throughput-compatible methodology may have potential for use in toxicity screening assays and mechanistic studies and may represent an alternative to animal models for studying DILI. Methotrexate (MTX) is the drug of first choice for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but is effective only in around 60% of the patients. Identification of genetic markers to predict response is essential for effective treatment within a critical window period of 6 months after diagnosis, but have been hitherto elusive. In this study, we used genome-wide genotype data to identify the potential risk variants associated with MTX (poor)response in a north Indian RA cohort. Genome-wide genotyping data for a total of 457 RA patients [297 good (DAS28-3â¤3.2) and 160 poor (DAS28-3â¥5.1) responders] on MTX monotherapy were tested for association using an additive model. Support vector machine and genome-wide pathway analysis were used to identify additional risk variants and pathways. All risk loci were imputed to fine-map the association signals and identify causal variant(s) of therapeutic/diagnostic relevance. Seven novel suggestive loci from genome-wide (Pâ¤5Ã10(-5)) and three from support vector machine analysis were associated with MTX (poor)response. The associations of published candidate genes namely DHFR (P=0.014), FPGS (P=0.035), and TYMS (P=0.005) and purine and nucleotide metabolism pathways were reconfirmed. Imputation, followed by bioinformatic analysis indicated possible interaction between two reversely oriented overlapping genes namely ENOSF1 and TYMS at the post-transcriptional level. In this first ever genome-wide analysis on MTX treatment response in RA patients, 10 new risk loci were identified. These preliminary findings warrant replication in independent studies. Further, TYMS expression at the post-transcriptional level seems to be probably regulated through an antisense-RNA involving the 6-bp ins/del marker in the overlapping segment at 3'UTR of TYMS-ENOSF1, a finding with impending pharmacogenetic applications. Germ cell sex is defined by factors derived from somatic cells. CYP26B1 is known to be a male sex-promoting factor that inactivates retinoic acid (RA) in somatic cells. In CYP26B1-null XY gonads, germ cells are exposed to a higher level of RA than in normal XY gonads and this activates Stra8 to induce meiosis while male-specific gene expression is suppressed. However, it is unknown whether meiotic entry by an elevated level of RA is responsible for the suppression of male-type gene expression. To address this question, we have generated Cyp26b1/Stra8 double knockout (dKO) embryos. We successfully suppressed the induction of meiosis in CYP26B1-null XY germ cells by removing the Stra8 gene. Concomitantly, we found that the male genetic program represented by the expression of NANOS2 and DNMT3L was totally rescued in about half of dKO germ cells, indicating that meiotic entry causes the suppression of male differentiation. However, half of the germ cells still failed to enter the appropriate male pathway in the dKO condition. Using microarray analyses together with immunohistochemistry, we found that KIT expression was accompanied by mitotic activation, but was canceled by inhibition of the RA signaling pathway. Taken together, we conclude that inhibition of RA is one of the essential factors to promote male germ cell differentiation, and that CYP26B1 suppresses two distinct genetic programs induced by RA: a Stra8-dependent meiotic pathway, and a Stra8-independent mitotic pathway. STAT-3 is a key transcriptional factor in the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated differentiation of Th17 cells. Because Th17 is believed to be a central player in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we sought to evaluate whether an endogenous inhibitor of the STAT3 gene, GRIM-19 (gene associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality 19), could attenuate the progression and severity of murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) through suppression of Th17 cells and, reciprocally, could increase expression of Treg cells. Overexpression of GRIM-19 was produced either by intravenous/intramuscular administration of a GRIM-19 overexpression vector in DBA1/J mice or by development of GRIM-19-transgenic (Tg) mice on a C57BL/6 background. Clinical signs were scored for arthritis severity, and mouse splenocytes, serum, and joint tissue were obtained for immunostaining and histologic analyses. The numbers of CD4+IL-17+ cells and CD4+pSTAT3+ cells were decreased, while the numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells and CD4+pSTAT5+ cells were increased, in both GRIM-19 vector-transfected and GRIM-19-Tg mice. Administration of the GRIM-19 overexpression vector into mice with CIA markedly suppressed the clinical and histologic signs of arthritis in the affected joints. Similarly, when CIA was induced in GRIM-19-Tg mice, the arthritis phenotype was markedly attenuated and the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, tumor necrosis factor Î±, and IL-17) in the arthritic joints was also significantly reduced. Moreover, bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages obtained from GRIM-19-Tg mice showed attenuated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. GRIM-19 improved the clinical and histologic features of CIA and also inhibited osteoclast formation. These findings suggest that GRIM-19 may be a novel treatment agent for RA. Imbalance between effector and regulatory T-cells (Treg) underlies the loss of immune-tolerance to self-antigens in autoimmune disease. In autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (AIH-2), effector CD4 T-cell immune responses to cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6) are permitted by numerically and functionally impaired Treg. Restoration of CYP2D6-specific Treg in AIH-2 would enable control over effectors sharing the same antigen specificity, leading to re-establishment of immune-tolerance. We have previously developed a protocol for generating antigen-specific Treg through co-culture with semi-mature dendritic cells presenting CYP2D6 peptides. In this study, we aimed to explore phenotypic and functional features of patient Treg compared to health, to test Treg stability under pro-inflammatory conditions, and to investigate the potential benefit of supplementation with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or rapamycin (RP), agents proven to enhance Treg function. We show that antigen-specific Treg from patients have comparable phenotypic and functional features to those from healthy controls, suppressing both proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by effector cells. Treg exposure to inflammatory challenge results in decreased suppressive function and up-regulation of Th1/Th2/Th17 transcription factors both in health and AIH-2. The increase of Th1 and Th17 transcription factors is limited by addition of RA in controls and Th1 expression is decreased by RP in patients. Importantly, inflammation-induced decrease in Treg function is also abrogated by RA/RP in health and RA in patients. Our data provide important information for the optimization of protocols aiming at generating antigen-specific Treg for treatment of autoimmune disease and for understanding their biology upon pro-inflammatory challenge and RP/RA supplementation. The aim of our study was to investigate adrenocortical function in the context of disease activity and inflammatory status in premenopausal RA females. Adrenal glucocorticoid and androgen responses to the 1 microg ACTH 1-24 test were investigated in 23 premenopausal RA and in 15 age- and BMI-matched healthy females. Twelve RA patients were on low-dose prednisone (<8.5 mg/day). Patients with DAS28>3.2 had lower (p<0.05) total plasma cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione responses in the ACTH test compared to healthy controls. Patients with DAS28>3.2 had lower (p<0.05) dehydroepiandrosterone response in the ACTH test compared to patients with DAS28</=3.2. C-reactive protein (CRP), DAS28, and interleukin (IL)-6 negatively correlated with androstenedione response to ACTH 1-24. Responses of all measured adrenal steroids were lower (p<0.05) in patients on low-dose glucocorticoids compared to healthy controls. RA patients not treated with glucocorticoids had lower total cortisol response (p=0.038) but did not differ in free plasma cortisol in the ACTH test. The results indicate an association of increased disease activity with a decrease in adrenal androgen production in RA and normal cortisol bioavailability in patients not treated with glucocorticoids. Loss of viability is one of the most important problems during starter culture production. Previous research has mostly focused on the production process of bacterial starters, but there are few studies about cellular protein deterioration causing cell defectiveness during storage. In the present study, we investigated the influence of storage temperature (-21, 4, 35Â°C) on the cellular protein modifications which may contribute to the senescence of freeze-dried Acetobacter senegalensis. Heterogeneous populations composed of culturable cells, viable but non-culturable cells (VBNC) and dead cells were generated when freeze-dried cells were kept at -21 and 4Â°C for 12 months whereas higher storage temperature (35Â°C) mainly caused death of the cells. The analysis of stored cell proteome by 2D-DiGE demonstrated a modified pattern of protein profile for cell kept at 4 and 35Â°C due to the formation of protein spot trains and shift of Isoelectric point (pI). Quantification of carbonylated protein by ELISA showed that the cells stored at 4 and 35Â°C had higher carbonylated protein contents than fresh cells. 2D-DiGE followed by Western blotting also confirmed the carbonylation of cellular proteins involved in translation process and energy generation. The auto-fluorescent feature of cells kept at 35Â°C increased significantly which may be an indication of protein glycation during storage. In addition, the percentage of cellular unsaturated fatty acid and the solubility of cellular proteins decreased upon storage of cells at higher temperature suggesting that peroxidation of fatty acids and possibly protein lipidation and oxidation occurred. High storage temperature induces some deteriorative reactions such as protein oxidation, lipidation and glycation which may cause further protein modifications like pI-shift, and protein insolubility. These modifications can partly account for the changes in cell viability. It can also be deduced that even moderate carbonylation of some critical cellular proteins (like ribosomal proteins) may lead to VBNC formation or death of freeze-dried bacteria. Moreover, it seems that other mechanisms of biomolecule deterioration preceding protein carbonylation lead to VBNC formation under very low storage temperature. Immune system activation is known to be involved in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this work was to study the imbalance expressions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TTS) with RA patients. Forty-nine RA patients and 49 healthy controls were studied. The expressions of IDO and TTS were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The expression of TTS mRNA increased significantly in RA patients when compared with healthy controls and correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.424, P < 0.01). In addition, we found TTS increased significantly mainly in CD3(+) T cells in rheumatoid arthritis group. Increased TTS expressions from CD3(+) T cells might link to a pathogenic mechanism involved in increasing survival of autoreactive T cells in RA patients. Determination of expressions of TTS may provide a better understanding of progression of the disease. Reduced generation of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) by CD103(+) intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) is linked to intestinal inflammation in mice. However, the role of RA in intestinal inflammation in humans is unclear. We investigated which antigen-presenting cells (APCs) produce RA in the human intestine and whether generation of RA is reduced in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Ileal and colonic tissues were collected from patients with CD during endoscopy or surgery, and healthy tissues were collected from subjects who were undergoing follow-up because of rectal bleeding, altered bowel habits, or cancer (controls). Cells were isolated from the tissue samples, and APCs were isolated by flow cytometry. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) activity was assessed by Aldefluor assay, and ALDH1A expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Macrophages were derived by incubation of human blood monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). CD103(+) and CD103(-) DCs and CD14(+) macrophages from healthy human intestine had RALDH activity. Although ALDH1A1 was not expressed by DCs, it was the predominant RALDH enzyme isoform expressed by intestinal CD14(+) macrophages and their putative precursors, CD14(+) monocytes. RALDH activity was up-regulated in all 3 populations of APCs from patients with CD; in CD14(+) macrophages, it was associated with local induction of ALDH1A1 expression. Blocking of RA receptor signaling during GM-CSF-mediated differentiation of monocytes into macrophages down-regulated CD14 and HLA-DR expression and reduced the development of tumor necrosis factor Î±-producing inflammatory macrophages. RA receptor signaling promotes differentiation of human tumor necrosis factor Î±-producing inflammatory macrophages in vitro. In vivo, more CD14(+) macrophages from the intestinal mucosa of patients with CD than from controls are capable of generating RA, which might increase the inflammatory phenotype of these cells. Strategies to reduce the generation of RA by CD14(+) macrophages could provide new therapeutic options for patients with CD. The role of endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) in the initiation and maintenance of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that disruption of GC signalling in osteoblasts results in a profound attenuation of K/BxN serum-induced arthritis, a mouse model of RA. To determine whether or not the modulation of the inflammatory response by osteoblasts involves T cells, we studied the effects of disrupted osteoblastic GC-signalling in the T cell-dependent model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Acute arthritis was induced in pre-immunised 11-week-old male 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 transgenic (tg) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum albumine (mBSA) into one knee joint. Knee diameter was measured every 1-2 days until euthanasia on day 14 post injection. In a separate experiment, arthritis was maintained for 28 days by weekly reinjections of mBSA. Tissues were analysed by histology, histomorphometry and microfocal-computed tomography. Serum cytokines levels were determined by multiplex suspension array. In both short and long term experiments, arthritis developed in tg and WT mice with no significant difference between both groups. Histological indices of inflammation, cartilage damage and bone erosion were similar in tg and WT mice. Bone volume and turnover at the contralateral tibia and systemic cytokine levels were not different. Acute murine AIA is not affected by a disruption in osteoblastic GC signalling. These data indicate that osteoblasts do not modulate the T cell-mediated inflammatory response via a GC-dependent pathway. The effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) and high natural radioactivity (HR) on catalase and MAPK genes in Vicia faba were investigated. Soil samples with high natural radioactivity were collected from Ramsar in north Iran where the annual radiation absorbed dose from background radiation is higher than 20mSv/year. The specific activity of the radionuclides of (232)Th, (236)Ra, and (40)K was measured using gamma spectrometry. The seeds were planted either in the soil with high natural radioactivity or in the control soils and were then exposed to a SMF of 30mT for 8 days; 8h/day. Levels of expression of catalase and MAPK genes, catalase activity and H2O2 content were evaluated. The results demonstrated significant differences in the expression of catalase and MAPK genes in SMF- and HR-treated plants compared to the controls. An increase in catalase activity was accompanied by increased expression of its gene and accumulation of H2O2. Relative expression of the MAPK gene in treated plants, however, was lower than those of the controls. The results suggest that the response of V. faba plants to SMF and HR may be mediated by modification of catalase and MAPK. In mammals, most neonatal male germ cells (prospermatogonia) are quiescent and located in the center of the testis cords. In response to an unknown signal, prospermatogonia transition into spermatogonia, reenter the cell cycle, divide, and move to the periphery of the testis cords. In mice, these events occur by 3-4 days postpartum (dpp), which temporally coincides with the onset of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in the neonatal testis. RA has a pivotal role in initiating germ cell entry into meiosis in both sexes, yet little is known about the mechanisms and about cellular changes downstream of RA signaling. We examined the role of RA in mediating the prospermatogonia-to-spermatogonia transition in vivo and found 24 h of precocious RA exposure-induced germ cell changes mimicking those that occur during the endogenous transition at 3-4 dpp. These changes included: 1) spermatogonia proliferation; 2) maturation of cellular organelles; and 3), expression of markers characteristic of differentiating spermatogonia. We found that germ cell exposure to RA did not lead to cellular loss from apoptosis but rather resulted in a delay of â¼2 days in their entry into meiosis. Taken together, our results indicate that exogenous RA induces multiple hallmarks of the transition of prospermatogonia to spermatogonia prior to their entry into meiosis. Retinoic acid (RA) induces mouse F9 cells to form primitive endoderm (PrE) and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompany differentiation. ROS are obligatory for differentiation and while H2O2 alone induces PrE, antioxidants attenuate the response to RA. Evidence shows that ROS can modulate the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway and in this study, we show that extraembryonic endoderm formation is dependent on the redox state of nucleoredoxin (NRX). In undifferentiated F9 cells, NRX interacted with dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and while this association was enhanced under reduced conditions, it decreased following H2O2 treatment. Depleting NRX levels caused morphological changes like those induced by RA, while increasing protein kinase A activity further induced these PrE cells to parietal endoderm. Reduced NRX levels also correlated to an increase in T-cell-factors-lymphoid enhancer factors-mediated transcription, indicative of canonical Wnt signaling. Together these results indicate that a mechanism exists whereby NRX maintains canonical Wnt signaling in the off state in F9 cells, while increased ROS levels lift these constraints. Dvl2 no longer bound to NRX is now positioned to prime the Wnt pathway(s) required for PrE formation. Pharmacological approaches to control spermatogenesis are required to resolve overpopulation in dogs. The objective of the study was to investigate the regulation of meiosis-associated and male germ cell-related genes, stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (STRA8), synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3), dosage suppressor of mck1 (DMC1), doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) and deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) following exogenous administration of retinoic acid (RA) and after the modulation of endogenous RA by a cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 inhibitor (CYP26B1-I; R115866) in an in vitro testis model. Testicles of five healthy, medium-sized and mixed-breed dogs were used for the organotypic cultures. All-trans-RA at 2 Î¼M, CYP26B1-I at 1 Î¼M and the control dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were administered to the testes cultures, and the cultures were maintained for 24 h. Genes STRA8, DAZL and DMRT1 were significantly up-regulated as a result of the direct and indirect increase in the RA levels in the testis, subsequent to the exogenous administration of all-trans-RA and CYP26B1 inhibitor. Up-regulation of STRA8 was very prominent compared to DAZL and DMRT, and the drastic up-regulation of STRA8 was also observed with CY26B1-I than with all-trans-RA. No significant differences were found with the early meiotic markers, SYCP3 and DMC1 with RA, CY26B1-I and vehicle treatments. Because DAZL encodes a germ cell-specific RNA-binding protein, required for the induction of STRA8 and initiation of meiosis, we might see the expression differences temporally with the stage of spermatogenesis. DMRT1 is a unique gonad- and stage-specific transcription factor, directly activates STRA8 and has the temporal influence on its expression. Protein expression of DAZL and STRA8 was greater in RA- and CYP26B1-I-treated testis culture, whereas DMRT1 showed greater protein expression for RA treatment, but not for CYP26B1-I treatment compared to control. Relative protein expression of STRA8 was greatest for the CYP26B1-I treatment compared to DMSO and RA treatments. In conclusion, pharmacological intervention of spermatogenesis pertinent to RA signalling is plausible, and the effect of modulation differs upon the types of molecules and the key stages of signalling being targeted. Plasma and synovial myeloperoxidase (MPO) and its products were strongly associated with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, it is well known that there is a link between oxidative stress and cytokines. The present study aims at investigating the link between synovial MPO (and its products), interleukin (IL)-18, which is involved in the degradation of articular cartilage in RA, and IL-8, which is involved in recruitment and activation of neutrophils during inflammation. Effects of the treatment of RA on the biological parameters were also investigated. Patients (n = 105) were studied including 39 patients with OA, 33 with RA and 33 with RA receiving a specific treatment. Disease activity score (DAS-28) was calculated whereas MPO antigen/activity, neutrophils, chloro-tyrosine (Cl-Tyr), homocitrulline (Hcit), IL-8, and IL-18 were measured in synovial fluid (SF) and CRP was measured in serum. DAS-28 and CRP levels were not significantly different between groups. MPO activity, and MPO, Cl-Tyr, and Hcit levels were significantly higher in SF of RA patients than OA patients. MPO specific activity (MPO activity/antigen ratio) was significantly lower in treated than in untreated RA patients as was IL-8. MPO activity and concentration were correlated with IL-8 and IL-18 in untreated but not in treated RA patients. MPO level is related to IL-8 and IL-18 levels in untreated RA patients. A link has been shown between treatment and decrease of IL-8, MPO specific activity and Hcit in SF. The causal role of MPO in SF inflammation and how treatment can affect MPO specific activity need further investigations. Skin irritation is one of the most common adverse reactions in hydroquinone (HQ) and retinoic acid (RA). Although melanocytes have rarely been considered to be involved in skin irritation, RA and particularly HQ could induce melanocyte toxicity, resulting in depigmentation. We chose S100B as a candidate gene for melanocytotoxicity from a genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis after applying irritant doses of HQ, RA and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) to cultures of keratinocytes and/or melanocytes. In this study, the role of S100B on melanocyte viability and cytotoxicity was examined. S100B was detected in melanocytes, but not in keratinocytes or fibroblasts. Melanocytes after treatment with increasing concentrations of HQ, RA, SLS and urushiol showed significant increases in intracellular and extracellular S100B expression with reduced viable cell number and increased release of lactate dehydrogenase. No RAGE expression and no significant function of CD166/ALCAM in melanocyte survival and cytotoxicity favoured the role of intracellular S100B in chemically irritated melanocytes. S100B knock-down increased apoptosis through inhibition of PI3K/AKT, NF-ÎºB and ERK activation, suggesting the increased intracellular S100B expression by chemical irritation as a compensatory reaction to reduce cytotoxicity. The numerical decrease in S100B/c-kit-double-positive melanocytes was also examined in human skin epidermis irritated by HQ or RA with stronger staining intensities of S100B. Collectively, the decrease in viable cell number by reduced intracellular S100B levels in vitro and by chemical irritation in vivo suggests that S100B could be a potential biomarker for melanocytes cytotoxicity. Methotrexate (MTX) is the cornerstone medication in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in enzymes of the folic acid pathway (folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase [FPGS], gamma-glutamyl hydrolase [GGH], and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR]) associate with significant adverse events (SigAE). Patients (n=319) enrolled in the Veterans Affairs RA (VARA) registry taking MTX were genotyped for HLA-DRB1-SE and the following SNPs: FPGS (rs7033913, rs10760503, rs10106), GGH (12548933, rs7010484, rs4617146, rs719235, rs11988534), MTHFR (rs1801131, rs1801133). AE were abstracted from the medical record using a structured instrument. SigAE were defined as an AE leading to MTX discontinuation. Covariates included: age, gender, race, RA antibody status, tobacco, RA disease duration between diagnosis and MTX course, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, glucocorticoids, use of prior RA medications, and mean 4-variable disease activity score. Cox regression was performed to determine factors associated with time-to-SigAE. A p-value â¤ 0.005 established significance in the final model. The presence of â¥ 1 copy of the minor allele in MTHFR rs1801131 was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of SigAE (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.48-6.29, p-value 0.003 and HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.62-9.28, p-value 0.002 for heterozygotes and homozygotes for the minor allele, respectively). An interaction term, between FPGS rs7033913 heterozygotes and GGH rs11988534 homozygotes for the minor allele, had a p-value <0.0001. RA subjects taking MTX may have decreased time-to-SigAE with â¥ 1 copy of the minor allele in MTHFR rs1801131. Further investigation is warranted, as these SNPs may indicate susceptibility to MTX toxicity. Paraneoplastic arthritis (PA) may mimic rheumatic diseases. While presenting the demographic and laboratory features of the patients diagnosed with PA, this study also aims to provide possible appropriate tools to differentiate the PA cases from early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). Sixty-five patients with PA (male/female: 43/22) from 15 different rheumatology clinics and 50 consecutive patients with ERA (male/female: 13/37) fulfilling the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the diagnosis if the RA from Gaziantep Rheumatology Early Arthritis Trial (GREAT) as controls who were diagnosed at least 12 months before, were enrolled into study. Mean ages of the patients with PA and ERA were 50.2 Â± 15.3, and 42.7 Â± 12.3, respectively, and the mean ages of the patients with PA were significantly higher than the ERA. Unlike the ERA patients, in our case series PA was predominantly observed among males. Oligoarthritis was significantly higher in solid tumors in contrast to ERA (P = 0.001). Polyarthritis and symmetric arthritis were significantly higher in the ERA group in contrast to all malignancies (P = 0.001). Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) positivity were significantly higher in the ERA group (each P = 0.001). Lactic dehydrogenase levels of hematologic malignancies were significantly higher than other groups (each, P = 0.001). ERA patients had more symmetric joint involvement than PA; laboratory markers could be also an alternative where there is high RF and anti-CCP positivity with antibody levels among the ERA patients. Finally, the demographic features can be used as differentiating factors; ERA was seen predominantly among females aged 40-59 years which refers to young adults. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) belongs to Bi syndrome (arthralgia) in Chinese medicine. Till now there lacks effective therapeutic methods. Recently cyclooxygenases (COXs) inhibitors, having regulator roles for many pro-inflammatory cytokines, have been widely used in RA treatment. But due to existing cardiovascular risks, researches on targeting the downstream specific factors of COXs have been under discussion. Considering the key role of blood stasis syndrome (BSS) in the pathology of RA and the fact that thromboxane A2 (TXA2) plays a pivotal role in BSS, we theoretically explored possible regulatory roles of Compound Danshen, a representative therapy in blood activating stasis removing method in the downstream path of COXs in synovial cells of RA. We proposed a brand new research direction of RA researches. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a selective inhibitor of mammalian histone deacetylase. In the present study, TSA was found to selectively increase gene expression of the pituitary gonadotropin Î²-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Stimulation of mouse pituitary gonadotroph cell lines, LÎ²T2, with TSA for 24 h resulted in no change in mRNA expression of the Î±- and LHÎ²-subunit. On the other hand, FSHÎ²-subunit mRNA expression was significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, specific induction of the FSHÎ²-subunit gene with TSA stimulation was observed in primary cultures of rat pituitary cells. Histone acetylation in whole cell lysates of LÎ²T2 cells was significantly increased after TSA treatment, but not gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment. The effect of TSA on FSHÎ² mRNA expression was prominent compared to that of GnRH; however, TSA-stimulated FSHÎ² mRNA expression was significantly reduced with combined TSA and GnRH treatment. TSA caused a slight increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, while GnRH-increased ERK phosphorylation was potentiated in the presence of TSA. In addition, TSA, but not GnRH, significantly stimulated gene expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), a retinoic acid (RA) synthesizing enzyme involved in cell differentiation. These findings demonstrate that TSA specifically increases FSHÎ² subunit gene expression with a concomitant increase in whole cell histone acetylation. Moreover, although GnRH is a stimulator of FSHÎ² gene expression, it interfered with the stimulatory effect of TSA on FSHÎ² mRNA expression, without modification of TSA-increased whole cell histone acetylation. This suggests that the mechanisms of TSA and GnRH-induced gonadotropin subunit gene expression are entirely distinct. Retinoic acid (RA) controls many aspects of embryonic development by binding to specific receptors (retinoic acid receptors [RARs]) that regulate complex transcriptional networks. Three different RAR subtypes are present in vertebrates and play both common and specific roles in transducing RA signaling. Specific activities of each receptor subtype can be correlated with its exclusive expression pattern, whereas shared activities between different subtypes are generally assimilated to functional redundancy. However, the question remains whether some subtype-specific activity still exists in regions or organs coexpressing multiple RAR subtypes. We tackled this issue at the transcriptional level using early zebrafish embryo as a model. Using morpholino knockdown, we specifically invalidated the zebrafish endogenous RAR subtypes in an in vivo context. After building up a list of RA-responsive genes in the zebrafish gastrula through a whole-transcriptome analysis, we compared this panel of genes with those that still respond to RA in embryos lacking one or another RAR subtype. Our work reveals that RAR subtypes do not have fully redundant functions at the transcriptional level but can transduce RA signal in a subtype-specific fashion. As a result, we define RAR subtype-specific transcriptotypes that correspond to repertoires of genes activated by different RAR subtypes. Finally, we found genes of the RA pathway (cyp26a1, raraa) the regulation of which by RA is highly robust and can even resist the knockdown of all RARs. This suggests that RA-responsive genes are differentially sensitive to alterations in the RA pathway and, in particular, cyp26a1 and raraa are under a high pressure to maintain signaling integrity. Morphological, physiological and molecular changes were investigated in in vitro salt-stressed barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Tokak). Mature embryos were cultured in Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0 (control), 50 and 100 mM NaCl for 20 days. Both concentrations inhibited shoot growth, decreased fresh weight and protein content, and increased SOD (EC 1.15.1.1) activity in a dose-dependent manner. The lower concentration increased root growth. Salinity caused nucleotide variations in roots, but did not affect shoot DNAs. The higher concentration caused methylation changes, mainly hypermethylation in shoots. This is the first study on genetic and epigenetic effects of salinity in barley. Xenopus laevis is among the few species that are capable of fully regenerating a lost lens de novo. This occurs upon removal of the lens, when secreted factors from the retina are permitted to reach the cornea epithelium and trigger it to form a new lens. Although many studies have investigated the retinal factors that initiate lens regeneration, relatively little is known about what factors support this process and make the cornea competent to form a lens. We presently investigate the role of Retinoic acid (RA) signaling in lens regeneration in Xenopus. RA is a highly important morphogen during vertebrate development, including the development of various eye tissues, and has been previously implicated in several regenerative processes as well. For instance, Wolffian lens regeneration in the newt requires active RA signaling. In contrast, we provide evidence here that lens regeneration in Xenopus actually depends on the attenuation of RA signaling, which is regulated by the RA-degrading enzyme CYP26. Using RT-PCR we examined the expression of RA synthesis and metabolism related genes within ocular tissues. We found expression of aldh1a1, aldh1a2, and aldh1a3, as well as cyp26a1 and cyp26b1 in both normal and regenerating corneal tissue. On the other hand, cyp26c1 does not appear to be expressed in either control or regenerating corneas, but it is expressed in the lens. Additionally in the lens, we found expression of aldh1a1 and aldh1a2, but not aldh1a3. Using an inhibitor of CYP26, and separately using exogenous retinoids, as well as RA signaling inhibitors, we demonstrate that CYP26 activity is necessary for lens regeneration to occur. We also find using phosphorylated Histone H3 labeling that CYP26 antagonism reduces cell proliferation in the cornea, and using qPCR we find that exogenous retinoids alter the expression of putative corneal stem cell markers. Furthermore, the Xenopus cornea is composed of an outer layer and inner basal epithelium, as well as a deeper fibrillar layer sparsely populated with cells. We employed antibody staining to visualize the localization of CYP26A, CYP26B, and RALDH1 within these corneal layers. Immunohistochemical staining of these enzymes revealed that all 3 proteins are expressed in both the outer and basal layers. CYP26A appears to be unique in also being present in the deeper fibrillar layer, which may contain cornea stem cells. This study reveals a clear molecular difference between newt and Xenopus lens regeneration, and it implicates CYP26 in the latter regenerative process. During embryogenesis, lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells first arise from a subset of blood vascular endothelial cells in the dorsolateral aspects of the cardinal veins. The molecular cues responsible for defining the regionalisation of such a discrete pool of progenitors remain uncharacterised. Here we identify a novel function for CYP26B1, an enzyme known to play a role in tissue morphogenesis by fine-tuning retinoic acid (RA) concentration, in regulating lymphangiogenesis. Cyp26b1-null mice, in which RA levels are elevated, exhibited an increased number of lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells in the cardinal veins, together with hyperplastic, blood filled lymph sacs and hyperplastic dermal lymphatic vessels. Conversely, mice over-expressing Cyp26b1 had hypoplastic lymph sacs and lymphatic vessels. Our data suggest that RA clearance by CYP26B1 in the vicinity of lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells is important for determining the position and size of the progenitor pool specified. Our studies identify a genetic pathway that underpins the architecture of the developing lymphatics and define CYP26B1 as a novel modulator of lymphatic vascular patterning. An excessive intake of vitamin A has been associated with an increased risk of fractures in humans. In animals, a high vitamin A intake leads to a reduction of long bone diameter and spontaneous fractures. Studies in rodents indicate that the bone thinning is due to increased periosteal bone resorption and reduced radial growth. Whether the latter is a consequence of direct effects on bone or indirect effects on appetite and general growth is unknown. In this study we therefore used pair-feeding and dynamic histomorphometry to investigate the direct effect of a high intake of vitamin A on bone formation in rats. Although there were no differences in body weight or femur length compared to controls, there was an approximately halved bone formation and mineral apposition rate at the femur diaphysis of rats fed vitamin A. To try to clarify the mechanism(s) behind this reduction, we treated primary human osteoblasts and a murine preosteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) with the active metabolite of vitamin A; retinoic acid (RA), a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist (AGN194310), and a Cyp26 inhibitor (R115866) which blocks endogenous RA catabolism. We found that RA, via RARs, suppressed in vitro mineralization. This was independent of a negative effect on osteoblast proliferation. Alkaline phosphatase and bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap, Osteocalcin) were drastically reduced in RA treated cells and RA also reduced the protein levels of Runx2 and Osterix, key transcription factors for progression to a mature osteoblast. Normal osteoblast differentiation involved up regulation of Cyp26b1, the major enzyme responsible for RA degradation, suggesting that a drop in RA signaling is required for osteogenesis analogous to what has been found for chondrogenesis. In addition, RA decreased Phex, an osteoblast/osteocyte protein necessary for mineralization. Taken together, our data indicate that vitamin A is a negative regulator of osteoblast mineralization. Delineating the mechanism or mechanisms that regulate the specification of hemogenic endothelial cells from primordial endothelium is critical for optimizing their derivation from human stem cells for clinical therapies. We previously determined that retinoic acid (RA) is required for hemogenic specification, as well as cell-cycle control, of endothelium during embryogenesis. Herein, we define the molecular signals downstream of RA that regulate hemogenic endothelial cell development and demonstrate that cell-cycle control is required for this process. We found that re-expression of c-Kit in RA-deficient (Raldh2(-/-)) primordial endothelium induced Notch signaling and p27 expression, which restored cell-cycle control and rescued hemogenic endothelial cell specification and function. Re-expression of p27 in RA-deficient and Notch-inactivated primordial endothelial cells was sufficient to correct their defects in cell-cycle regulation and hemogenic endothelial cell development. Thus, RA regulation of hemogenic endothelial cell specification requires c-Kit, notch signaling, and p27-mediated cell-cycle control. Cytochrome P450 26A1 (cyp26a1) is expressed in the mouse uterus during peri-implantation. The repression of this protein is closely associated with a reduction in implantation sites, suggesting a specific role for cyp26a1 in pregnancy and prompting questions concerning how a metabolic enzyme can generate this distinct outcome. To explore the effective downstream targets of cyp26a1 and confirm if its role in peri-implantation depends on its metabolic substrate RA (retinoic acid), we characterized the changes in the peripheral blood, spleen and uterine implantation sites using the cyp26a1 gene vaccine constructed before. Flow cytometry results showed a significant increase in CD4(+) RORÎ³t(+) Th17 cells in both the peripheral blood and spleen in the experimental group. The expression of RORÎ³t and IL-17 presented the Th17 cells reduction in uterus followed by the suppression of cyp26a1 expression. For greater certainty, cyp26a1 antibody blocking model and RNA interference model were constructed to determine the precise target immune cell group. High performance liquid chromatography results showed a significant increase in uterine at-RA followed by the immunization of cyp26a1 gene vaccine. Both the ascertain by measuring RARÎ± protein levels in peri-implantation uterus after gene vaccine immunization and researches using the specific agonist and antagonist against RARÎ± suggested that RARÎ± may be the main RA receptor for signal transduction. These results provided more evidence for the signal messenger role of RA in cyp26a1 regulation from the other side. Here, we showed that the cyp26a1-regulated Th17 cells are dependent on at-RA signalling, which is delivered through RARÎ± in mouse peri-implantation. To evaluate the association between inflammation, oxidative stress, and circulating progenitor cell (CPC) number and redox equilibrium, vascular lesions and accelerated atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Circulating CD34+ cells were isolated from 33 RA patients and 33 controls. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mRNA expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase type 1 (GPx-1) antioxidant enzymes, and the gp91phox-containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase NOX2 were measured in CD34+ cells. C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and arterial stiffness (AS) were also evaluated. We investigated the relationships between inflammatory markers, vascular parameters, cell number, and antioxidant enzymes. CD34+ cell number was lower in RA patients than in controls. In CD34+ cells from RA patients, ROS levels, MnSOD mRNA, and NOX2 mRNA were higher, while mRNA expression of GPx-1 and CAT was significantly lower. The AS, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (AIx) were higher, as was cIMT. CD34+ cell number was inversely correlated with CRP, ROS, PWV, and AIx, and with the CAT/MnSOD and GPx-1/MnSOD ratios. CRP was correlated with MnSOD mRNA, PWV, and AIx but not with CAT and GPx-1 mRNA. Our data show a link between inflammation, oxidative stress, and the impairment of the antioxidant system of CPCs and their number, and with arterial stiffness in RA subjects. This could suggest a perspective on the accelerated development of vascular damage and atherosclerosis in RA. Studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and mice with arthritis demonstrated tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) cells in arthritic synovium and parallel loss of sympathetic nerve fibres. The exact function of TH(+) cells and mode of TH induction are not known. Synovial cells of RA/OA were isolated and cultured under normoxic/hypoxic conditions with/without stimulating enzyme cofactors of TH and inhibitors of TH. We studied TH expression and release of cytokines/catecholamines. In vivo function was tested by cell therapy with TH(+) neuronal precursor cells (TH(+) neuronal cells) in DBA/1 mice with collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA). Compared with normoxic conditions, hypoxia increased TH protein expression and catecholamine synthesis and decreased release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in OA/RA synovial cells. This inhibitory effect on TNF was reversed by TH inhibition with Î±-methyl-para-tyrosine (Î±MPT), which was particularly evident under hypoxic conditions. Incubation with specific TH cofactors (tetrahydrobiopterin and Fe(2+)) increased hypoxia-induced inhibition of TNF, which was also reversed by Î±MPT. To address a possible clinical role of TH(+) cells, murine TH(+) neuronal cells were generated from mesenchymal stem cells. TH(+) neuronal cells exhibited a typical catecholaminergic phenotype. Adoptive transfer of TH(+) neuronal cells markedly reduced CIA in mice, and 6-hydroxydopamine, which depletes TH(+) cells, reversed this effect. The anti-inflammatory effect of TH(+) neuronal cells on experimental arthritis has been presented for the first time. In RA/OA, TH(+) synovial cells have TH-dependent anti-inflammatory capacities, which are augmented under hypoxia. Using generated TH(+) neuronal cells might open new avenues for cell-based therapy. To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety, dosage administration, and adverse effects of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Primary sources of information were obtained from clinical studies, which were identified through PubMed (1966 to June 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to March 2013) using terms: tofacitinib, tasocitinib, CP-690550, and CP-690,550. Information was used from tofacitinib package insert, guidelines, and published abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism. Data search was limited to include publications in English language and from human subjects. Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Tofacitinib was efficacious in RA patients, indicated by achievements of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria. Similar improvements were observed in patients who met remission criteria based on the Disease Activity Scores 28 criteria and quality of life as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Tofacitinib was associated with infections and malignancies; and elevations in serum creatinine and lipids were observed. Drug interactions with inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 and 2C9 isoenzymes were reported. Tofacitinib is an oral treatment option for RA patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Postmarket surveillance will provide further insight to tofacitinib's role in RA therapy, especially in patients who may require different types of combination therapy with DMARDS. During vertebrate development, the primary body axis elongates towards the posterior and is periodically divided into somites, which give rise to the vertebrae, skeletal muscles and dermis. Somites form periodically from anterior to posterior, and the anterior somites form in a more rapid cycle than the posterior somites. However, how this anteroposterior (AP) difference in somitogenesis is generated and how it contributes to the vertebrate body plan remain unclear. Here, we show that the AP difference in zebrafish somitogenesis originates from a variable overlapping segmentation period between one somite and the next. The AP difference is attributable to spatiotemporal inhibition of the clock gene her1 via retinoic acid (RA) regulation of the transcriptional repressor ripply1. RA depletion thus disrupts timely somite formation at the transition, eventually leading to the loss of one somite and the resultant cervical vertebra. Overall, our results indicate that RA regulation of the AP difference is crucial for proper linkage between the head and trunk in the vertebrate body plan. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an important site of metabolic control in the pentose phosphate pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the enzyme activity of G6PD in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome (SS) patients not known to be deficient in this enzyme. It was also within the scope of the aim to find the relation of G6PD to the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in these patients. Erythrocyte G6PD activity was evaluated in 40 RA patients, 30 SS patients and in 30 age- and sex-matched control. The clinical characteristics, disease activity score (DAS28), SS disease activity (SSDAI) and damage (SSDDI) indices and presence of MetS of the included patients were analyzed in relation to the enzyme level. The G6PD activity in RA patients (7.72 Â± 3.57 U/g Hb) was significantly reduced compared to that in the SS patients (11.55 Â± 3.14 U/g Hb) and control (13.23 Â± 3.34 U/g Hb) especially those with MetS (4.61 Â± 1.84 U/g Hb) (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation of the G6PD activity with the disease duration and DAS28 (p < 0.001). The results of this study, suggest that G6PD not only does not protect against MetS in RA, but may even be considered a risk factor for the development of this disorder. The identification of regulatory tools for G6PD activity may prove promising for treating the associated metabolic disorders and chronic inflammation in RA. In mammals, ontogenesis starts from a fusion of spermatozoon and oocyte, which are produced by reductive nuclear division of a diploid germ cell in a specialised but complex biological process known as meiosis. However, little is known about the mechanism of meiotic initiation in germ cells, although many factors may be responsible for meiosis both in male and female gonads. In this study, 11.5 days post coitum (dpc) female fetal mouse genital ridges were cultured in vitro with exposure to Brefeldin A (BFA) for 6h, and the changes in meiosis were detected. Synaptonemal-complex analysis implied that BFA played a positive role in meiosis initiation and this hypothesis was confirmed by quantitative PCR of meiosis-specific genes: stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) and deleted in a zoospermia-like (DAZL). At the same time, mRNA expression of retinoic acid synthetase (Raldh2) and retinoic acid (RA) receptors increased in female gonads with in vitro exposure to BFA. Transplanting genital ridges treated with BFA into the kidney capsule of immunodeficient mice demonstrated that the development capacity of female germ cells was normal, while formation of primordial follicles was seen to be a result of accelerated meiosis after exposure to BFA. In conclusion, the study indicated that BFA stimulated meiosis initiation partly by RA signalling and then promoted the development of follicles. Extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) requiring oxygen therapy often experience frequent episodes of intermittent hypoxia (IH) and are at high risk for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Using an established model for oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), we examined the hypothesis that there is a critical number of daily brief IH episodes which will result in irreversible retinal oxidative damage. Newborn rats were exposed to increasing daily clustered IH episodes (12% Oâ with 50% Oâ) from postnatal day (P) 0 to P7 or P0 to P14, or placed in room air (RA) until P21 following 7- or 14-day IH. RA littermates at P7, P14, and P21 served as controls. A group exposed to constant 50% Oâ (CH) served as a second control. Blood gases, eye opening at P14, retinal, and choroidal oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (8-isoPGF(2Î±)), oxidants (HâOâ) and antioxidants (catalase and SOD), retinal pathology (adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase)-stained retinal flatmounts), and mitochondria-related genes were assessed. pOâ levels were higher with increasing IH episodes and remained elevated during the reoxygenation period. High SOâ levels were associated with most severe OIR. Levels of all measured biomarkers peaked with six IH episodes and decreased with 8 to 12 episodes. HâOâ accumulated in the choroid during the reoxygenation period with irreversible retinal damage. Our data suggest that six is the maximum number of IH episodes that the retina can sustain. Accumulation of HâOâ in the choroid may result in high levels being delivered to the entire retina, ultimately resulting in irreversible retinal oxidative damage. To investigate whether baseline concentrations of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers are associated with treatment nonresponse and adverse events in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving methotrexate (MTX). A prospective derivation cohort (n = 285) and validation cohort (n = 102) of RA patients receiving MTX were studied. Concentrations of plasma homocysteine, serum vitamin B12 , serum folate, erythrocyte vitamin B6 , and erythrocyte folate were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Nonresponse after 3 months was assessed using the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Adverse events at 3 months were assessed using biochemical parameters and health status questionnaires. Analyses were corrected for baseline DAS28, age, sex, MTX dose, comedications, and presence of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype. In the derivation cohort, the mean DAS28 scores at baseline and 3 months were 4.94 and 3.12, respectively, and 78% of patients experienced adverse events. This was similar between the 2 cohorts, despite a lower MTX dose in the validation cohort. Patients with lower levels of erythrocyte folate at baseline had a higher DAS28 at 3 months in both the derivation cohort (Î² = -0.15, P = 0.037) and the validation cohort (Î² = -0.20, P = 0.048). In line with these results, lower baseline erythrocyte folate levels were linearly associated with a 3-month DAS28 of >3.2 in both cohorts (derivation cohort, P = 0.049; validation cohort, P = 0.021) and with nonresponse according to the EULAR criteria (derivation cohort, P = 0.066; validation cohort, P = 0.027). None of the other biomarkers (levels at baseline or changes over 3 months) were associated with the DAS28 or treatment nonresponse. Baseline levels of the biomarkers and changes in levels after 3 months were not associated with incidence of adverse events. A low baseline concentration of erythrocyte folate is associated with high disease activity and nonresponse at 3 months after the start of MTX treatment and could be used in prediction models for MTX outcome. None of the investigated one-carbon metabolism biomarkers were associated with incidence of adverse events at 3 months. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), a marker of oxidative stress, are prevalent in many kinds of disorders. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mainly resulting from the dysfunction of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), is related to oxidative stress. Although the increased levels of AOPPs in RA patients were reported, the effect of AOPPs on FLSs function still remains unclear. Therefore, our study aims to investigate whether AOPPs have an effect on the inflammatory response of FLSs in vitro. FLSs obtained from both knees of rats were treated with or without AOPPs-modified rat serum albumin (AOPPs-RSA) in vitro. The mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin(IL)-1Î², matrix metalloproteinases(MMP)-3, MMP-13 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected by fluorescent microscope and fluorescence microplate reader. Immunoprecipitation, Co-Immunoprecipitation and western blot were performed to examine the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB). Exposure of FLSs to AOPPs upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², MMP-3, MMP-13 and VEGF in a concentration dependent manner. AOPPs treatment triggered ROS production in FLSs, which was significantly abolished by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and apocynin. Challenged AOPPs induced phosphorylation of p47(phox), triggered an interaction between p47(phox), p22(phox) and gp91(phox), and significantly upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox), p22(phox) and gp91(phox). IÎºB degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB p65 induced by AOPPs were significantly blocked by SOD, NAC, DPI and apocynin. These data indicate that AOPPs induce inflammatory response in FLSs is medicated through NADPH oxidase-dependent activation of NF-ÎºB. In this decade, the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx), which is related to pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD), has attracted much attention because it may provide a possible explanation for individual differences in the clinical efficacy of drugs. For the development of personalized drug therapy, it is important to accumulate evidence from PK/PD/PGx analysis in clinical trials. Warfarin (WF) is one of the most widely prescribed anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolism. However, large interindividual and interethnic differences have been observed in the WF dose required to elicit the anticoagulant effect. We investigated the factors influencing the WF maintenance dose in Japanese patients. Our study confirmed a large interindividual variability in the WF maintenance dose that was due to a VKORC1 1639 G>A polymorphism and differences in body weight, age, and serum albumin. In addition, we found that the CYP4F2 genotype affects the plasma concentration of menaquinone-4, and that this finding was correlated with the WF sensitivity index in Japanese pediatric patients. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate that is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cancer. The response to low-dose MTX demonstrated wide interpatient variability; however, the contributing factors remain unclear. We found that the frequency of the RFC1 80A allele was higher in RA patients treated with MTX alone compared with patients who received biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). This finding may support the combined use of bDMARDs and MTX. Further large-scale prospective clinical trials are required to confirm these findings. Retinoids have been reported to exert depigmenting activity. Unlike most depigmenting agents that target tyrosinase, they are not phenolic agents and may act via different mechanisms. We analysed the properties of retinaldehyde (RAL), a precursor of retinoic acid (RA), as a skin-lightening agent in various models. The viability and the depigmenting properties of RAL were assessed in murine melanocytes, in human reconstructed epidermis, and in mice and guinea pigs. The melanin content and cytotoxicity were assessed in melanocytes; in 3-dimensional models, the melanin concentration and the number of active melanocytes were determined. RAL was taken up by melanocytes and mostly metabolised to retinol and retinyl esters, and to a lesser extent to RA. RAL decreased the melanin concentration of guinea pig ears and mouse tails by 54 and 74%, respectively, and decreased the number of active melanocytes by 42 and 77%, respectively. In reconstructed epidermis the melanin concentration was increased by 52%, whereas the number of active melanocytes decreased by 44%. RAL exerts a significant depigmenting activity with a mode of action that looks different from that of RA. Our data suggest a skin-lightening effect related to a melanolytic action (i.e. a decrease in melanin concentration, whatever the mechanism) rather than to melanocytotoxicity, besides other still unknown actions of RAL on melanocytes. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop from a specialized subpopulation of endothelial cells known as hemogenic endothelium (HE). Although the HE origin of HSCs is now well established in different species, the signaling pathways that control this transition remain poorly understood. Here, we show that activation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in aorta-gonad-mesonephros-derived HE ex vivo dramatically enhanced its HSC potential, whereas conditional inactivation of the RA metabolizing enzyme retinal dehydrogenase 2 in VE-cadherin expressing endothelial cells in vivo abrogated HSC development. Wnt signaling completely blocked the HSC inductive effects of RA modulators, whereas inhibition of the pathway promoted the development of HSCs in the absence of RA signaling. Collectively, these findings position RA and Wnt signaling as key regulators of HSC development and in doing so provide molecular insights that will aid in developing strategies for their generation from pluripotent stem cells. Methotrexate (MTX) is considered the main agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Neurotoxicity is often mild, but severe encephalopathy can develop, especially with intrathecal or intravenous administration. In rare cases, this syndrome has been observed in patients on long-term low-dose oral administration. A 68-year-old male was diagnosed with RA and on treatment with oral MTX 25 mg weekly for 4 years. The patient started with progressive dysarthria, ataxia and cognitive dysfunction. Complementary tests were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintense lesions in both cerebellar hemispheres on T2-weighted and FLAIR images with a diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). On postgadolinium T1-weighted images, there were mild enhancements. Spectroscopy showed a demyelinating pattern. A pharmacogenetics determination was made, showing a heterozygous genotype in the MTHFR and ABCB1 genes. Medication with antirheumatic drug was stopped immediately on admission, and the patient gradually improved. MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy can occur even with low-dose administration. The exact pathogenic mechanism is still unknown, but it is hypothesised that it could be the result of a cumulative toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier. The nature of the relationship between the polymorphism and CNS toxicity is still unclear, and thus, further studies are warranted. Often located in the occipital lobes, the involvement of the cerebellum is quite rare. Early recognition of the condition and withdrawal of the drug lead to a better prognosis. The vitamin A (retinol) and its metabolites such as retinoic acid (RA) affect vertebrate gametogenesis. The level of RA in cells relies on the balance between its synthesis and degradation. The sex-dependent equilibrium is reached in different ways in various species. It is known that RA induces meiosis in developing gonads in mouse, chicken and urodel amphibians, but its role in anuran amphibians has not been studied. Here we show in six anuran species (Xenopus laevis, Bombina bombina, Hyla arborea, Bufo viridis, Rana arvalis and Rana temporaria) that cultured undifferentiated gonads were insensitive to RA treatment, but the RA induced ectopic meiosis in cultured larval testes. In larval testes of all studied species, the exogenous RA induced leptotene phase of I meiotic prophase in gonia, but only in H. arborea and B. viridis gonia progressed to zygotene phase. In the cultured developing ovaries, exogenous RA led to increase in the number of oocytes as compared to the control. Inhibition of either RA synthesis or RA-receptors prevented meiotic entry in larval gonads of all species. Exogenous RA rescued this inhibitory effect demonstrating that the balance in RA homeostasis plays a key role in meiotic entry in anuran gonads. The localization of two enzymes, Raldh2 and Cyp26b1, which antagonistically control RA levels and whose abundance suggests the sites of RA synthesis and degradation respectively, showed two distinct expression patterns specific for (i) X. laevis, H. arborea, R. arvalis, R. temporaria and (ii) B. bombina, B. viridis. Thus, RA, in correlation with specific expression patterns of Raldh2 and Cyp26b, induces meiosis during gonad development in anurans. In addition, in B. viridis, RA signalling seems important for development of the Bidder's organ containing oocytes both in males and females. Prostanoids and PGE2 in particular have been long viewed as one of the major mediators of inflammation in arthritis. However, experimental data indicate that PGE2 can serve both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. We have previously shown (Kojima et al., J. Immunol. 180 (2008) 8361-8368) that microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) deletion, which regulates PGE2 production, resulted in the suppression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. This suppression was attributable, at least in part, to the impaired generation of type II collagen autoantibodies. In order to examine the function of mPGES-1 and PGE2 in a non-autoimmune form of arthritis, we used the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model in mice deficient in mPGES-1, thereby bypassing the engagement of the adaptive immune response in arthritis development. Here we report that mPGES-1 deletion significantly increased CAIA disease severity. The latter was associated with a significant (~3.6) upregulation of neutrophil, but not macrophage, recruitment to the inflamed joints. The lipidomic analysis of the arthritic mouse paws by quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) revealed a dramatic (~59-fold) reduction of PGE2 at the peak of arthritis. Altogether, this study highlights mPGES-1 and its product PGE2 as important negative regulators of neutrophil-mediated inflammation and suggests that specific mPGES-1 inhibitors may have differential effects on different types of inflammation. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated diseases could be exacerbated by inhibition of mPGES-1. The high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) suggests an important role for retinoic acid (RA) signaling in determining the fate of these cells. We found that primitive human bone marrow-derived CD34(+)CD38(-) cells not only highly express aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, but also the RA receptor Î±. Despite the up-regulation of early components of RA signaling, the downstream pathway remained inactive in the primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Primitive hematopoietic cells rapidly undergo terminal differentiation when cultured away from their microenvironment; however, we found that inhibition of RA signaling maintained their primitive phenotype and function, and promoted their self-renewal. HSCs reside in a complex microenvironment that enforces the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The exact physiologic mechanisms by which the niche controls HSC fate remain elusive. The embryonic gonadal microenvironment has recently been shown to determine germ-cell fate by degrading RA through expression of the P450 retinoid-inactivating enzyme CYP26B1. We found that the bone marrow microenvironment similarly can control primitive hematopoietic cell fate via modulation of retinoid bioavailability. Accordingly, we found that bone marrow stromal cell CYP26 was also able to inactivate retinoids in serum, preventing RA signaling. Thus, primitive hematopoietic cells appear to be intrinsically programmed to undergo RA-mediated differentiation unless prevented from doing so by bone marrow niche CYP26. Modulation of RA signaling also holds promise for clinical HSC expansion, a prerequisite for the wide-scale use of these cells in regenerative medicine and gene therapy. To help understand the elusive mechanisms of zebrafish sex determination, we studied the genetic machinery regulating production and breakdown of retinoic acid (RA) during the onset of meiosis in gonadogenesis. Results uncovered unexpected mechanistic differences between zebrafish and mammals. Conserved synteny and expression analyses revealed that cyp26a1 in zebrafish and its paralog Cyp26b1 in tetrapods independently became the primary genes encoding enzymes available for gonadal RA-degradation, showing lineage-specific subfunctionalization of vertebrate genome duplication (VGD) paralogs. Experiments showed that zebrafish express aldh1a2, which encodes an RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the gonad rather than in the mesonephros as in mouse. Germ cells in bipotential gonads of all zebrafish analyzed were labeled by the early meiotic marker sycp3, suggesting that in zebrafish, the onset of meiosis is not sexually dimorphic as it is in mouse and is independent of Stra8, which is required in mouse but was lost in teleosts. Analysis of dead-end knockdown zebrafish depleted of germ cells revealed the germ cell-independent onset and maintenance of gonadal aldh1a2 and cyp26a1 expression. After meiosis initiated, somatic cell expression of cyp26a1 became sexually dimorphic: up-regulated in testes but not ovaries. Meiotic germ cells expressing the synaptonemal complex gene sycp3 occupied islands of somatic cells that lacked cyp26a1 expression, as predicted by the hypothesis that Cyp26a1 acts as a meiosis-inhibiting factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, females up-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes that entered prophase-I meiotic arrest, and down-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes resuming meiosis. Co-expression of cyp26a1 and the pluripotent germ cell stem cell marker pou5f1(oct4) in meiotically arrested oocytes was consistent with roles in mouse to promote germ cell survival and to prevent apoptosis, mechanisms that are central for tipping the sexual fate of gonads towards the female pathway in zebrafish. Estrogen synthesis in adipose tissue is associated with the development of breast cancer. Tumors are preferentially found in breast quadrants with strongest expression of the cytochrome P450 aromatase (encoded by the gene CYP19A1). Several promoters regulated by various hormonal factors drive aromatase expression in human breast adipose fibroblasts (BAFs). As adipose tissue is a major source of retinoids, in this study, we investigated their role in the regulation of aromatase expression. The retinoids all-trans-retinoic acid (at-RA) and 9-cis-RA induce aromatase activity in human BAFs. In BAFs, at-RA induces aromatase gene expression via promoter I.4. In 3T3-L1 cells, both retinoids specifically drive luciferase reporter gene expression under the control of aromatase promoter I.4, whereas other promoters active in human adipose tissue are insensitive. Activation by retinoids depends on a 467âbp fragment (-256/+211) of promoter I.4 containing four putative retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that only RARE2 (+91/+105) mediates the retinoid-dependent induction of reporter gene activity. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and human BAFs, RA receptor Î± (RARÎ± (RARA)) expression is predominant, whereas RARÎ² (RARB) or RARÎ³ (RARG) expression is low. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts obtained from human BAFs and 3T3-L1 cells identified a specific RARE2-binding complex. Retinoids enhanced complex formation, whereas pre-incubation with anti-RARÎ± antibodies prohibited the binding of RARÎ± to RARE2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed RA-dependent binding of RARÎ± to the RARE2-containing promoter region in vivo. Furthermore, we provide evidence that RARE2 is also necessary for the basal activation of promoter I.4 in these cells. Taken together, these findings indicate a novel retinoid-dependent mechanism of aromatase activity induction in adipose tissue. Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hypothyroidism tend to cluster, and this coexistence amplifies the elevated cardiovascular risk in RA. Whether thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOabs) are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has not been studied extensively. Therefore, this study determined firstly the prevalence of TPOabs in RA and secondly whether TPOabs were associated with CVD. Moreover, this study explored whether TPOabs were related to RA characteristics. Data from the CARRÃ Study, an ongoing study investigating CVDs and its risk factors in RA (n=322), was used to ascertain the prevalence of TPOabs in RA patients. In addition, cardiovascular and RA disease characteristics were compared between TPOabs-positive and -negative patients at baseline and at a second visit after 3 years. TPOabs were present in 47/322 (15%) RA patients and TSH levels were higher in TPOabs-positive patients (1.40âmU/l) compared with TPOabs-negative patients (1.26âmU/l, P=0.048). At baseline and after 3 years no association was observed between TPOabs and (risk factors for) CVD. Regression analyses revealed a significantly larger progression of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT; Î²=0.13âmm) in TPOabs-positive compared with TPOabs-negative patients independent of risk factors for cIMT progression. RA disease activity scores (DAS28) were higher in TPOabs-positive compared with TPOabs-negative patients (4.4 vs 3.8 P=0.018). TPOabs were associated with increased cIMT progression. Moreover, an association between TPOabs and DAS28 was observed. Hence, TPOabs seems to have a role in the amplified cardiovascular risk in RA patients. The fish optic nerve regeneration process takes more than 100 days after axotomy and comprises four stages: neurite sprouting (1-4 days), axonal elongation (5-30 days), synaptic refinement (35-80 days) and functional recovery (100-120 days). We screened genes specifically upregulated in each stage from axotomized fish retina. The mRNAs for heat shock protein 70 and insulin-like growth factor-1 rapidly increased in the retinal ganglion cells soon after axotomy and function as cell-survival factors. Purpurin mRNA rapidly and transiently increased in the photoreceptors and purpurin protein diffusely increased in all nuclear layers at 1-4 days after injury. The purpurin gene has an active retinol-binding site and a signal peptide. Purpurin with retinol functions as a sprouting factor for thin neurites. This neurite-sprouting effect was closely mimicked by retinoic acid and blocked by its inhibitor. We propose that purpurin works as a retinol transporter to supply retinoic acid to damaged RGCs which in turn activates target genes. We also searched for genes involved in the second stage of regeneration. The mRNA of retinoid-signaling molecules increased in retinal ganglion cells at 7-14 days after injury and tissue transglutaminase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase mRNAs, RA-target genes, increased in retinal ganglion cells at 10-30 days after injury. They function as factors for the outgrowth of thick, long neurites. Here we present a retinoid-signaling hypothesis to explain molecular events during the early stages of optic nerve regeneration in fish. To gain information about how alkoxy substitution in arene rings of Î²-O-4 structural units within lignin governs the efficiencies/rates of radical cation C1-C2 bond cleavage reactions, single electron transfer (SET) photochemical and lignin peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation reactions of dimeric/tetrameric model compounds have been explored. The results show that the radical cations derived from less alkoxy-substituted dimeric Î²-O-4 models undergo more rapid C1-C2 bond cleavage than those of more alkoxy-substituted analogues. These findings gained support from the results of DFT calculations, which demonstrate that C1-C2 bond dissociation energies of Î²-O-4 radical cations decrease as the degree of alkoxy substitution decreases. In SET reactions of tetrameric compounds consisting of two Î²-O-4 units, containing different degrees of alkoxy substitution, regioselective radical cation C-C bond cleavage was observed to occur in one case at the C1-C2 bond in the less alkoxy-substituted Î²-O-4 moiety. However, regioselective C1-C2 cleavage in the more alkoxy-substituted Î²-O-4 moiety was observed in another case, suggesting that other factors might participate in controlling this process. These observations show that lignins containing greater proportions of less rather than more alkoxylated rings as part of Î²-O-4 units would be more efficiently cleaved by SET mechanisms. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) has potent immunomodulatory properties that affect T cell differentiation, migration and function. However, the precise role of RA metabolism in T cells remains unclear. Catabolism of RA is mediated by the Cyp26 family of cytochrome P450 oxidases. We examined the role of Cyp26b1, the T cell-specific family member, in CD4(+) T cells. Mice with a conditional knockout of Cyp26b1 in T cells (Cyp26b1 (-/-) mice) displayed normal lymphoid development but showed an increased sensitivity to serum retinoids, which led to increased differentiation under both inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cell- and TH17 cell-polarizing conditions in vitro. Further, Cyp26b1 expression was differentially regulated in iTreg and TH17 cells. Transfer of naÃ¯ve Cyp26b1 (-/-) CD4(+) T cells into Rag1 (-/-) mice resulted in significantly reduced disease in a model of T cell-dependent colitis. Our results show that T cell-specific expression of Cyp26b1 is required for the development of T cell-mediated colitis and may be applicable to the development of therapeutics that target Cyp26b1 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Normal embryonic development and tissue homeostasis require precise levels of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Despite the importance of appropriate embryonic RA signaling levels, the mechanisms underlying congenital defects due to perturbations of RA signaling are not completely understood. Here, we report that zebrafish embryos deficient for RA receptor Î±b1 (RARÎ±b1), a conserved RAR splice variant, have enlarged hearts with increased cardiomyocyte (CM) specification, which are surprisingly the consequence of increased RA signaling. Importantly, depletion of RARÎ±b2 or concurrent depletion of RARÎ±b1 and RARÎ±b2 also results in increased RA signaling, suggesting this effect is a broader consequence of RAR depletion. Concurrent depletion of RARÎ±b1 and Cyp26a1, an enzyme that facilitates degradation of RA, and employment of a novel transgenic RA sensor line support the hypothesis that the increases in RA signaling in RAR deficient embryos are the result of increased embryonic RA coupled with compensatory RAR expression. Our results support an intriguing novel mechanism by which depletion of RARs elicits a previously unrecognized positive feedback loop that can result in developmental defects due to teratogenic increases in embryonic RA. Retinoic acid (RA) is involved in multifarious and complex functions necessary for vertebrate development. RA signaling is reliant on strict enzymatic regulation of RA synthesis and metabolism. Improper spatiotemporal expression of RA during development can result in vertebrate axis defects. microRNAs (miRNAs) are also pivotal in orchestrating developmental processes. While mechanistic links between miRNAs and axial development are established, the role of miRNAs in regulating metabolic enzymes responsible for RA abundance during axis formation has yet to be elucidated. Our results uncovered a role of miR-19 family members in controlling RA metabolism through the regulation of CYP26A1 during vertebrate axis formation. Global miRNA expression profiling showed that developmental RA exposure suppressed the expression of miR-19 family members during zebrafish somitogenesis. A reporter assay confirmed that cyp26a1 is a bona fide target of miR-19 in vivo. Transient knockdown of miR-19 phenocopied axis defects caused by RA exposure. Exogenous miR-19 rescued the axis defects induced by RA exposure. Taken together, these results indicate that the teratogenic effects of RA exposure result, in part, from repression of miR-19 expression and subsequent misregulation of cyp26a1. This highlights a previously unidentified role of miR-19 in facilitating vertebrate axis development via regulation of RA signaling. We recently demonstrated better outcomes in helminth-infected multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, compared with uninfected ones. The present study evaluates the role of TLR2 and retinoic acid (RA) in parasite-driven protection in MS patients. RA serum levels were significantly higher in helminth-infected MS patients than in uninfected MS subjects or healthy controls. Genes involved in RA biosynthesis and metabolism, such as Adh1 and Raldh2, as well as RA receptors and IL-10, were induced in dendritic cells (DCs) via TLR2-dependent ERK signaling. This programmed DCs to induce FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells and suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF-Î±) via induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), an effect mediated by soluble egg Ag (SEA) obtained from Schistosoma mansoni, and by RA. SEA-activated DCs also inhibited IL-17 and IFN-Î³ production through autoreactive T cells. These inhibitory effects were abrogated when SOCS3 gene expression was silenced, indicating that SEA-mediated signaling inhibited production of these cytokines by T cells, through a SOCS3-dependent pathway. Overall, helminth-related immunomodulation observed in MS patients was mediated by TLR2- and RA-dependent pathways, through two different mechanisms, as follows: 1) induction of IL-10 and FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells, and 2) suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production mediated by SOCS3. The molecular mechanisms governing sex determination and differentiation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) are not fully understood. To gain more insights into the function of specific genes in these complex processes, the expression of multiple candidates needs to be assessed, preferably on the protein level. Here, we developed a targeted proteomics method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to study the candidate sex-related proteins in zebrafish which were selected based on a global proteomics analysis of adult gonads and representational difference analysis of male and female DNA, as well as on published information on zebrafish and other vertebrates. We employed the developed SRM protocols to acquire time-resolved protein expression profiles during the gonad differentiation period in vas::EGFP transgenic zebrafish. Evidence on protein expression was obtained for the first time for several candidate genes previously studied only on the mRNA level or suggested by bioinformatic predictions. Tuba1b (tubulin alpha 1b), initially included in the study as one of the potential housekeeping proteins, was found to be preferentially expressed in the adult testis with nearly absent expression in the ovary. The revealed changes in protein expression patterns associated with gonad differentiation suggest that several of the examined proteins, especially Ilf2 and Ilf3 (interleukin enhancer-binding factors 2 and 3), Raldh3 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 3), Zgc:195027 (low density lipoprotein-related receptor protein 3) and Sept5a (septin 5a), may play a specific role in the sexual differentiation in zebrafish. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis. Mouse intestinal CD103âº dendritic cells (DCs) produce a high level of RA by highly expressing retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH)2, an enzyme that converts retinal to RA, and induce gut-homing T cells. However, it has not been identified which subset of human DCs produce a high level of RA. In this study, we show that CD1câº blood myeloid DCs (mDCs) but not CD141(high) mDCs or plasmacytoid DCs exhibited a high level of RALDH2 mRNA and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in an RA- and p38-dependent manner when stimulated with 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin Dâ (VDâ) in the presence of GM-CSF. The ALDH activity was abrogated by TLR ligands or TNF. CD103â» rather than CD103âº human mesenteric lymph node mDCs gained ALDH activity in response to VDâ. Furthermore, unlike in humans, mouse conventional DCs in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes gained ALDH activity in response to GM-CSF alone. RALDH2(high) CD1câº mDCs stimulated naive CD4âº T cells to express gut-homing molecules and to produce Th2 cytokines in an RA-dependent manner. This study suggests that CD1câº mDCs are a major human DC subset that produces RA in response to VDâ in the steady state. The "vitamin D-CD1câºmDC-RA" axis may constitute an important immune component for maintaining tissue homeostasis in humans. Although activated inflammatory monocytes (IMCs) and inflammatory dendritic cells (IDCs) are potent T cell suppressors, nonactivated IMCs and IDCs promote T cell activation and Th1/Th17 cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated how to reduce the proinflammatory properties of IMCs and IDCs and further convert them into immune regulatory dendritic cells (DCs). We found that IL-4 and retinoic acid (RA) cotreatment of GM-CSF-differentiated IDCs synergistically induced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, a rate-limiting enzyme for RA synthesis in DCs. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs upregulated CD103 expression and markedly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon activation. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs strongly induced CD4âºFoxp3âº regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factors Stat6 and RA receptor Î² play important roles in aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, induction. In addition, IL-4 and RA signaling pathways interact closely to enhance the regulatory function of treated DCs. Adoptive transfer of IL-4 plus RA-treated DCs significantly increased regulatory T cell frequency in vivo. Direct treatment with IL-4 and RA also markedly suppressed actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data demonstrate the synergistic effect of IL-4 and RA in inducing a regulatory phenotype in IDCs, providing a potential treatment strategy for autoimmune diseases. The prefrontal cortex shows structural and functional alterations in mood disorders. Retinoid signaling, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its receptor TrkB are reported to be involved in depression. Here, we found that mRNA levels of key elements of retinoid signaling were significantly reduced in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) from elderly depressed patients who did not die from suicide. Decreased mRNA levels of BDNF and TrkB isoforms were also found. Similar alterations were observed in rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Along with neurons immunopositive for both retinoic acid receptor-Î± (RARÎ±) and TrkB, a positive correlation between mRNA levels of the 2 receptors was found in the ACC of control subjects but not of depressed patients. In vitro studies showed that RARÎ± was able to bind to and transactivate the TrkB promoter via a putative RA response element within the TrkB promoter. In conclusion, the retinoid and BDNF-TrkB signaling in the prefrontal cortex are compromised in mood disorders, and the transcriptional upregulation of TrkB by RARÎ± provide a possible mechanism for their interaction. The retinoid signaling pathway that may activate TrkB expression will be an alternative novel target for BDNF-based antidepressant treatment. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are considered to be essential for tumor maintenance, recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, eradication of CSCs/CICs is essential to cure cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms of CSCs/CICs are still elusive. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the cell growth of oral CSCs/CICs. Oral CSCs/CICs were isolated as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 bright (ALDH1(br)) cells by the ALDEFLUOR assay. Small proline-rich protein-1B (SPRR1B) gene was shown to be overexpressed in ALDH1(br) cells by a cDNA microarray and RT-PCR. SPRR1B was shown to have a role in cell growth and maintenance of ALDH1(br) cells by SPRR1B overexpression and knockdown experiments. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which SPRR1B regulates cell growth, further cDNA microarray analysis was performed using SPRR1B-overexpressed cells and cells with SPRR1B knocked down by siRNA. Expression of the tumor suppressor gene Ras association domain family member 4 (RASSF4) was found to be suppressed in SPRR1B-overexpressed cells. On the other hand, the expression of RASSF4 was enhanced in cells in which SPRR1B expression was knocked down by SPRR1B-specific siRNA. RASSF4 has an RA (Ras association) domain, and we thus hypothesized that RASSF4 modulates the MAP kinase signal downstream of the Ras signal. MAP kinase signal was activated in SPRR1B-overexpressed cells, whereas the signal was suppressed in SPRR1B knocked down cells. Taken together, the results indicate that the expression of SPRR1B is upregulated in oral CSCs/CICs and that SPRR1B has a role in cell growth by suppression of RASSF4. The ability to differentiate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into specific cell types is critical for improved regenerative medicine strategies, cancer chemotherapeutic approaches, and regimens to combat chronic diseases associated with aging. Subclasses of motor neurons (MNs) are generated at different positions along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord, and the signals that specify MN subtype fates remain poorly defined. We show here that the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp26a1, which metabolizes all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and thereby reduces RA levels, plays a crucial role in specifying MN columnar subtypes. Lack of Cyp26a1 in ESCs during differentiation to spinal MNs increases Aldh1a2 (RALDH2) and Hoxc6, markers of the Hox-dependent, lateral motor column (LMC) subtype identity. In contrast, Lhx3, a marker for median motor column identity, showed lower expression in Cyp26a1(-/-)-derived MNs compared with WT. Without Cyp26a1, an increase in intracellular RA concentration plus sonic hedgehog agonist treatment confer an LMC fate on differentiating MNs. Our data suggest a strategy for increasing LMC-type MNs from ESCs by blocking Cyp26a1 in cell replacement/ESC differentiation therapy to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To show the involvement of lymphocyte-derived catecholamines in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated the change in expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, by CD4+ T lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues of DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA model was induced by chicken type II collagen in DBA/1 mice. The joints of the mice were observed for clinical score of swelling on and after the 22nd day of primary immunization. Pathological changes of ankles were examined by staining of tissue sections with hematoxylin and eosin on the 35th and 55th day following primary immunization. Immunofluorescent histochemistry was used to identify the number of TH-positive, CD4-positive, and double-labeled cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Paw-swelling onset was on days 29 - 32 after the first immunization in DBA/1 mice. Clinical score for swelling of the paws reached peak on day 46 after the first immunization. Compared with the ankles of intact or vehicle mice, the joints of CIA mice had these characteristics: increased inflammatory cells in the synovial tissues, proliferated synoviocytes in the multilayers, narrowed articular space, and destructed articular cartilages. Simultaneously, the number of TH-positive, CD4-positive, and double-labeled cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen was significantly increased on days 35 and 55 following the first immunization. Between day 35 and day 55 post-immunization, there was no significant difference in the number of these positive cells. CD4+ T lymphocytes up-regulate TH expression in the process of CIA and therefore, it is suggested that endogenous catecholamines of lymphocytes involve in the pathogenesis of RA. 11Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11Î²-HSD1) plays an important role in inflammation. However, the role of 11Î²-HSD1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a selective 11Î²-HSD1 inhibitor BVT-2733 in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and its underlying mechanisms. CIA mice were treated with BVT-2733 (100 mg/kg, orally) or vehicle twice daily for 2 weeks. Arthritis score and joint histology were investigated. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as anti-type II collagen antibody (anti-CII) were detected by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to assess the activation of NF-ÎºB and NLRP1 inflammasome in joint tissues and in human RA synovial cells. BVT-2733 treatment attenuated the arthritis severity and anti-CII level in CIA mice. BVT-2733 also decreased the levels of serum TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-17. BVT-2733 treatment also significantly reduced synovial inflammation and joint destruction. NF-ÎºB activation and NLRP1 inflammasome assembly were also inhibited in arthritic joints and human RA synovial cells. In conclusion, BVT-2733 exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect on CIA. This protective effect is, at least partly, mediated by inhibition of the NF-ÎºB and NLRP1 inflammasome signaling pathways. 11Î²-HSD1 inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic target for RA patients. Piperine, a main component of Piper species, is a plant alkaloid with a long history of medical use in a variety of inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Due to side effects in current treatment modalities of rheumatoid arthritis, the interest in alternative, well tolerated anti-inflammatory remedies has re-emerged. The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects of piperine. Arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by collagen induced arthritis (CIA) method. Piperine was administered at a dose of 100mgkg(-1) and indomethacin at 1mgkg(-1) body weight once daily for 21days. The effects of treatment in the rats were assessed by biochemical (articular elastase, MPO, LPO, GSH, Catalase, SOD and NO), inflammatory mediators (IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IL-10 and PGE2) and histological studies in joints. Piperine was effective in bringing significant changes on all the parameters (articular elastase, MPO, LPO, GSH, Catalase, SOD and NO) studied. Oral administration of piperine resulted in significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and PGE2) and increased level of IL-10. The protective effects of piperine against RA were also evident from the decrease in arthritis scoring and bone histology. In conclusion, the fact that piperine alter a number of factors known to be involved in RA pathogenesis indicates that piperine can be used similar to indomethacin as a safe and effective therapy for CIA and may be useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are overproduced by activated macrophages in RA. As scavengers of ROS, enzymatic proteins such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) have a great therapeutic potential; however, in vivo application is limited especially when they are orally administered. Although, the oral route is the most convenient for drug administration, therapeutic proteins are easily degraded in vivo by the harsh conditions of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we introduce a novel drug delivery system composed of zein, a plant storage protein derived from maize. We demonstrate that zein nanoparticles can protect therapeutic proteins, catalase and SOD, from the harsh conditions of GI tract. Folate-conjugated catalase or SOD in zein nanoparticles can target the activated macrophages and scavenge the ROS generated by macrophages in vitro. This novel drug delivery system will be applicable to other orally administered treatments based on the protective property in the harsh conditions of GI tract. To determine whether methotrexate (MTX) affects the expression of genes involved in the transport [SLC19A1 (RFC1), ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (multidrug resistance proteins 1), ABCG2 (BCRP)], metabolism [Î³-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH), folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS)], and mechanism of action of MTX [thymidylate synthase, MTR, MTRR] in rheumatoid synovium. Synovial tissue samples were obtained from 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Gene expression was undertaken using quantitative real-time PCR. All the genes examined were expressed in all samples. Expression of SLC19A1, GGH, FPGS, ABCC1, and MTRR was significantly higher in patients receiving MTX compared to those not receiving MTX (p < 0.05). The ratio of FPGS:GGH gene expression was 2.7 Â± 0.51 ng/ml GAPDH (range 0.67-9.58). Genes involved in the transport, metabolism, and mechanism of action of MTX are expressed in rheumatoid joint synovium. These data provide evidence that MTX has the potential to be polyglutamated within the joint. The higher expression of FPGS compared to GGH in synovial tissue might favor production of long-chain MTX polyglutamates. Thus MTX has the potential to exert its therapeutic effects at the primary site of the inflammatory process in RA. The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of retinoids in the hypoactivity and hyporeactivity to stress of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in LOU/C rats. We measured the effects of vitamin A deficiency administered or not with retinoic acid (RA) on plasma corticosterone in standard conditions and in response to restraint stress and on hypothalamic and hippocampal expression of corticosteroid receptors, corticotropin-releasing hormone and 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Î²-HSD1) in LOU/C rats. Interestingly, under control conditions, we measured a higher plasma concentration of retinol in LOU/C than in Wistar rats, which could contribute to the lower basal activity of the HPA axis in LOU/C rats. Vitamin A deficiency induced an increased HPA axis activity in LOU/C rats, normalized by RA administration. Compared with LOU/C control rats, vitamin A-deficient rats showed a delayed and heightened corticosterone response to restraint stress. The expression of corticosteroid receptors was strongly decreased by vitamin A deficiency in the hippocampus, which could contribute to a less efficient feedback by corticosterone on HPA axis tone. The expression of 11Î²-HSD1 was increased by vitamin A deficiency in the hypothalamus (+62.5%) as in the hippocampus (+104.7%), which could lead to a higher production of corticosterone locally and contribute to alteration of the hippocampus. RA supplementation treatment restored corticosterone concentrations and 11Î²-HSD1 expression to control levels. The high vitamin A status of LOU/C rats could contribute to their low HPA axis activity/reactivity and to a protective effect against 11Î²-HSD1-mediated deleterious action on cognitive performances during ageing. Rare, recurrent genomic imbalances facilitate the association of genotype with abnormalities at the "whole body" level. However, at the cellular level, the functional consequences of recurrent genomic abnormalities and how they can be linked to the phenotype are much less investigated. We report an example of a functional analysis of two genes from a new, overlapping microdeletion of 2p13.2 region (from 72,140,702-72,924,626). The subjects shared intellectual disability (ID), language delay, hyperactivity, facial asymmetry, ear malformations, and vertebral and/or craniofacial abnormalities. The overlapping region included two genes, EXOC6B and CYP26B1, which are involved in exocytosis/Notch signaling and retinoic acid (RA) metabolism, respectively, and are of critical importance for early morphogenesis, symmetry as well as craniofacial, skeleton and brain development. The abnormal function of EXOC6B was documented in patient lymphoblasts by its reduced expression and with perturbed expression of Notch signaling pathway genes HES1 and RBPJ, previously noted to be the consequence of EXOC6B dysfunction in animal and cell line models. Similarly, the function of CYP26B1 was affected by the deletion since the retinoic acid induced expression of this gene in patient lymphoblasts was significantly lower compared to controls (8% of controls). Haploinsufficiency of CYP26B1 and EXOC6B genes involved in retinoic acid and exocyst/Notch signaling pathways, respectively, has not been reported previously in humans. The developmental anomalies and phenotypic features of our subjects are in keeping with the dysfunction of these genes, considering their known role. Documenting their dysfunction at the cellular level in patient cells enhanced our understanding of biological processes which contribute to the clinical phenotype. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family, and is primarily expressed in cardiac muscle tissue. Previously, we found that FABP3 is highly expressed in patients with ventricular-septal defects and is often used as a plasma biomarker in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and may play a significant role in the development of these defects in humans. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of FABP3 in the embryonic development of the zebrafish heart, and specifically how morpholino (MO) mediated knockdown of FABP3 would affect heart development in this species. Our results revealed that knockdown of FABP3 caused significant impairment of cardiac development observed, including developmental delay, pericardial edema, a linear heart tube phenotype, incomplete cardiac loop formation, abnormal positioning of the ventricles and atria, downregulated expression of cardiac-specific markers and decreased heart rate. Mechanistically, our data showed that the retinoic acid (RA) catabolizing enzyme Cyp26a1 was upregulated in FABP3-MO zebrafish, as indicated by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. On the other hand, the expression level of the RA synthesizing enzyme Raldh2 did not significantly change in FABP3-MO injected zebrafish. Collectively, our results indicated that FABP3 knockdown had significant effects on cardiac development, and that dysregulated RA signaling was one of the mechanisms underlying this effect. As a result, these studies identify FABP3 as a candidate gene underlying the etiology of congenital heart defects. We have succeeded to produce a high content of ricinoleic acid (RA), a hydroxylated fatty acid with great values as a petrochemical replacement, in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by introducing Claviceps purpurea oleate Î12-hydroxylase gene (CpFAH12). Although the production was toxic to S. pombe cells, we solved the problem by identifying plg7, encoding phospholipase A2, as a multicopy suppressor. Characterization of the RA-tolerant strains suggested that the removal of RA moieties from phospholipids would be the suppression mechanism by plg7. In this study, we extended our analysis and report our new discovery that the overexpression of plg7 enabled cells to secrete free RA into culture media. When the FAH12 integrant in the absence of the overexpressed plg7 was grown at 20 Â°C for 11 days, the amount of intracellular RA reached 200.1 Î¼g/ml of culture and only 69.3 Î¼g/ml of RA was detected in culture media. On the other hand, the FAH12 integrant harboring the plg7 multicopy plasmid secreted RA in the media (184.5 Î¼g/ml) without decreasing the amount in the cells, i.e., a significantly higher total secretion and a lead to making RA by its secretory production in S. pombe. Retinoic acid (RA) is used pharmacologically to treat neuroblastoma (NB), but its mechanism of action is unclear and it has limited use against refractory disease. This study investigated the expression of LSD1 (also known as KDM1A) in tumors, and assessed the efficacy of combining RA treatment with the inhibition of LSD1 expression. LSD1 protein expression levels were assessed semi-quantitatively in specimens of NB and ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), along with the apoptosis markers, Bcl-2 and Bax. The combined effect of RA and LSD1 siRNA inhibition on cell death was then assessed in the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. LSD1 expression was higher in NB compared to GNB, and LSD1 overexpression directly correlated with Bcl-2 expression and inversely correlated with Bax expression. RA treatment or LSD1 siRNA inhibition alone inhibited the growth of SH-SY5Y cells, but did not cause significant apoptosis or cell death. Combined treatment led to higher rates of SH-SY5Y cell death, as reflected by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The combined effect of RA and LSD1 siRNA inhibition had a synergistic effect on promoting the apoptosis of NB cells. This novel approach may improve the clinical treatment of NB. Experimental animal study. This study investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) mediated protein nitration is involved in the pathogenesis of radiculopathy and whether the symptoms can be relieved by its suppression. It has been reported that nitration of protein mediated by NO is involved in the degenerative neurological disorders, but its involvement is not clear in the radiculopathy. Two kinds of rat models of radiculopathy were used. Radiculopathy was induced either by ligation of spinal nerve roots or transplantation of autologous nucleus pulposus. In separate groups of rats, aminoguanidine, a potent nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor, was administered just before induction of radiculopathy, to suppress NO production and resultant nitration of protein. Sensation of the hind limb was evaluated by plantar stimulation test, and motor weakness was assessed by observation of gait pattern. Nitrotyrosine, product of protein nitration, was assayed quantitatively by Western immunoblotting. Mechanical allodynia was observed in both compression and nucleus pulposus groups, but motor weakness was observed only in the compression group. Preoperative administration of aminoguanidine attenuated mechanical allodynia and motor weakness. Optical densities of nitrotyrosine bands increased significantly in radiculopathy groups, but they were lowered by administration of aminoguanidine. NO mediated protein nitration contributes to the development of both types of radiculopathies. Suppression of NO production can decrease protein nitration and relieve neural dysfunctions of radiculopathy. N/A. Polyphenolic anthocyanins are major colorful compounds in red fruits, known to prevent cardiovascular and other diseases. Grape polyphenols are a mixture of various molecules and their exact contribution to above bioactivities remains to be clarified. In the present study, we first analyzed the effect of purified grape-derived compounds on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) survival, proliferation, as well as for their ability to inhibit the activation of human normal macrophages. Data indicated that malvidin-3-O-Î² glucoside (MalÎ²g), the major grape anthocyanin, is bioactive with no toxicity on human PBMC. MalÎ²g decreased the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediators, confirmed by the inhibition of TNFÎ±, IL1, IL-6 and iNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) secretion from activated macrophages. As MalÎ²g also inhibited inflammatory response of rat macrophages, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of MalÎ²g in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). MalÎ²g significantly diminished inflammatory cachexia and arthritic paw scores in AIA rats at both therapeutic and preventive levels. In vivo effects of MalÎ²g correlated with down-regulation of NO generation from AIA rats' peritoneal macrophages ex vivo. These data indicate that MalÎ²g, major grape anthocyanin, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo, without detectable toxic effect. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is reported to reduce hair cell loss and hearing deterioration caused by noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The present study investigates the involvement of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx 6) in ATRA-mediated protection of temporary threshold shift of hearing. Mice fed with ATRA before or after exposure to white noise showed a faster recovery than untreated controls within 1 week, with a concomitant increase of cochlear Prdx 6 expression. Treatment of mouse auditory cells with ATRA induced Prdx 6 expression. A putative retinoic acid (RA)-response element (RARE) was identified in a murine Prdx 6 promoter region. Prdx 6 promoter activities were elevated in wild-type reporter plasmid-transfected cells, whereas no significant change in activity was in those with RARE-disrupted mutant reporter. RA receptor Î± (RARÎ±) functions as a transactivator of Prdx 6 gene expression. These findings suggest that ATRA-induced Prdx 6 expression may be associated with rapid recovery from temporary NIHL. Nitric oxide (NO), a short-lived gaseous free radical, is a potent mediator of biological responses involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Nitric oxide also serves as an important signal in physiological processes, including angiogenesis, thrombosis, and bone turnover, which are known to be related to the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis. We investigated whether NOS3 gene polymorphisms are associated with risk of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Five polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 306 controls, 150 SLE patients, and 50 SLE patients with ONFH (SLE_ONFH). We found that Asp258Asp and Glu298Asp (G894T) polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene were significantly associated with risk of ONFH. Additionally, we calculated haplotype frequencies of a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block in NOS3 (rs1799983 - rs1800780) and tested for haplotype associations. The haplotypes G-A and T-A showed significant protective (P = 1.6 Ã 10(-3); OR 0.39, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0.22-0.7) and increased risk (P = 2.0 x 10(-5)-6.0 x 10(-4); OR 3.17-3.73) effects for ONFH, respectively. These results suggest that exonic NOS3 polymorphisms may increase the risk of ONFH in Korean SLE patients. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune-based disease of the connective tissue with still unknown etiology. Numerous studies have indicated the association between Copper (Cu) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) concentrations and pathogenesis of RA. To compare the concentrations of Cu and Cp in different biological samples and their correlation with the inflammatory process, between a group of patients with RA and a control group of healthy individuals. The study enrolled 74 Caucasian patients (20 men and 54 women), aged 29-50 (mean age 39.8Â±6.1 years) diagnosed with RA. The control group consisted of 30 healthy Caucasian individuals. Copper levels were assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Among RA patients the mean Cu level was significantly higher in serum and hair compartments and significantly lower in erythrocytes, compared with the control group (p<0.01). The Cp concentration was also higher in serum of RA patients (p<0.001). A statistically significant, positive correlation between the Cp serum concentration and the ESR values (r(s)=0.38; p<0.007) was found. No significant influence of pharmaceutical treatment (methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, calcium, vitamin D3 and sulphasalazine) on serum Cu was found. It seems that the 'copper status' in patients with RA, based on the measurement of Cu and Cp levels in blood serum is correlated with presence of the inflammatory process. The hair could serve as a useful, additional diagnostic material. Some other factors, different from the applied treatment, can probably influence the Cu levels in patients with RA. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling controls patterning and neuronal differentiation within the hindbrain, but forebrain RA function remains controversial. RA is produced from metabolism of retinol to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenase (RDH), followed by metabolism of retinaldehyde to RA by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH). Previous studies on Raldh2-/- and Raldh3-/- mice demonstrated an RA requirement for Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and dopaminergic differentiation in forebrain basal ganglia, but no RA requirement was observed during early forebrain patterning or subsequent forebrain cortical expansion. However, other studies suggested that RA controls forebrain patterning, and analysis of ethylnitrosourea-induced Rdh10 mutants suggested that RA synthesized in the meninges stimulates forebrain cortical expansion. We generated Rdh10-/- mouse embryos that lack RA activity early in the head and later in the meninges. We observed defects in hindbrain patterning and eye RA signaling, but early forebrain patterning was unaffected. Retinaldehyde treatment of Rdh10-/- embryos from E7-E9 rescues a cranial skeletal defect, resulting in E14.5 embryos lacking meningeal RA activity but maintaining normal forebrain shape and cortical expansion. Rdh10-/- embryos demonstrate that RA controls hindbrain but not early forebrain patterning, while studies on retinaldehyde-rescued Rdh10-/- embryos show that meningeal RA synthesis is unnecessary to stimulate forebrain cortical expansion. Retinoic acid (RA) is present at sites of neurogenesis in both the embryonic and adult brain. While it is widely accepted that RA signaling is involved in the regulation of neural stem cell differentiation, little is known about vitamin A utilization and biosynthesis of active retinoids in the neurogenic niches, or about the details of retinoid metabolism in neural stem cells and differentiating progenies. Here we provide data on retinoid responsiveness and RA production of distinct neural stem cell/neural progenitor populations. In addition, we demonstrate differentiation-related changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins of the retinoid machinery, including components responsible for uptake (Stra6) and storage (Lrat) of vitamin A, transport of retinoids (Rbp4, CrbpI, CrabpI-II), synthesis (Rdh10, Raldh1-4), degradation of RA (Cyp26a1-c1) and RA signaling (RarÎ±,Î²,Î³, RxrÎ±,Î²,Î³). We show that both early embryonic neuroectodermal (NE-4C) stem cells and late embryonic or adult derived radial glia like progenitors (RGl cells) are capable to produce bioactive retinoids but respond differently to retinoid signals. However, while neuronal differentiation of RGl cells can not be induced by RA, neuron formation by NE-4C cells is initiated by both RA and RA-precursors (retinol or retinyl acetate). The data indicate that endogenous RA production, at least in some neural stem cell populations, may result in autocrine regulation of neuronal differentiation. Chemotherapy in cancer patients is still not satisfactory because of drug resistance. The main mechanism of drug resistance results from the ability of cancer cells to actively expel therapeutic agents via transport proteins of the ABC family. ABCB1 and ABCG2 are the two main proteins responsible for drug resistance in cancers. Recent investigations indicate that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) can also be involved in drug resistance. Expression of the ABC transporters and ALDH enzymes is observed in normal stem cells, cancer stem cells and drug resistant cancers. Current chemotherapy regimens remove the bulk of the tumour but are usually not effective against cancer stem cells (CSCs) expressing ALDH. As a result, the number of ALDH positive drug resistant CSCs increases after chemotherapy. This indicates that therapies targeting drug resistant CSCs should be developed. A number of therapies targeting CSCs are currently under investigation. These therapies include differentiation therapy using different retinoic acids (RA) as simple agents or in combination with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Therapies that target cancer stem cell signaling pathways are also under investigation. A number of natural compounds are effective against cancer stem cells and lead to decreasing numbers of ALDH positive cells and downregulation of the ABC proteins. Combinations of differentiation therapies or therapies targeting CSC signaling pathways with classical cytostatics seem promising. This review discusses the role of ALDH and ABC proteins in the development of drug resistance in cancer and current therapies designed to target CSCs. The anuran amphibian Xenopus laevis can regenerate its limbs for a limited time during the larval stage, while limbs are still developing. Using this regeneration model, we evaluated the proximo-distal blastema cell identity when endogenous retinoids were increased by CYP26 inhibition or when RAR-specific agonists altered RA signaling. Simultaneous proximo-distal and antero-posterior limb duplications were generated, and the RAR-specific agonist can modify blastema identity after amputation, because chemical activation of RARÎ² produced bilateral hindlimb duplications that resulted in a drastic duplication phenotype of regenerating limbs. Retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, is an important endogenous signaling molecule regulating cell cycle and maintenance of epithelia. RA isomers are also used as drugs to treat various cancers and dermatological diseases. However, the therapeutic uses of RA isomers are limited due to side effects such as teratogenicity and resistance to treatment emerging mainly from autoinduction of RA metabolism. To improve the therapeutic usefulness of retinoids, RA metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs) have been developed. These inhibitors generally target the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes because RA clearance is predominantly mediated by P450s. Since the initial identification of inhibitors of RA metabolism, CYP26 enzymes have been characterized as the main enzymes responsible for RA clearance. This makes CYP26 enzymes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics for cancer and dermatological conditions. The basic principle of development of CYP26 inhibitors is that endogenous RA concentrations will be increased in the presence of a CYP26 inhibitor, thus, potentiating the activity of endogenous RA in a cell-type specific manner. This will reduce side effects compared to administration of RA and allow for more targeted therapy. In clinical trials, inhibitors of RA metabolism have been effective in treatment of psoriasis and other dermatological conditions as well as in some cancers. However, no CYP26 inhibitor has yet been approved for clinical use. This review summarizes the history of development of RAMBAs, the clinical and preclinical studies with the various structural series and the available knowledge of structure activity relationships of CYP26 inhibitors. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the joints. Polymorphic variations of the cytokine genes and MTHFR gene have received attention as potential markers of susceptibility, severity, and/or protection in RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the MTHFR C677T and IL-4 70bp VNTR variation in Turkish patients with RA and evaluate if there was an association with clinical features, especially ocular involvement, in RA patients. The study included 297 persons (147 patients with RA and 150 healthy controls). Genomic DNA was isolated and genotyped using PCR assay for the MTHFR gene C677T and IL-4 gene 70bp VNTR polymorphisms. Our results show that there was statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to IL-4 genotype (p=0.01) and allele frequencies (p<0.002). There was no statistical significant difference in the genotype frequencies MTHFR gene, but allele frequencies showed statistically significant association (p=0.01). When we examined MTHFR and IL-4 genotype frequencies according to the clinical characteristics, we found that there was a difference between MTHFR genotypes and ocular involvement but it is not to a statistical significant degree (p=0.09). In the combined genotype analysis, MTHFR/IL-4 CCP2P2 combine genotype was estimated to have protective effect against RA, CTP1P2 combine genotype was found to be risk for RA. Our findings suggest that there is an association of IL-4 gene 70bp VNTR polymorphism and MTHFR C677T polymorphism with susceptibility of a person for development of RA. The immune system has evolved regulatory mechanisms to control immune responses to self-antigens. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a pivotal role in maintaining immune tolerance, but tumour growth is associated with local immunosuppression, which can subvert effector immune responses. Indeed, the induction and recruitment of Treg cells by tumours is a major barrier in the development of effective immunotherapeutics and vaccines against cancer. Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to promote conversion of naÃ¯ve T cells into Treg cells. This study addresses the hypothesis that blocking RA receptor alpha (RARÎ±) may enhance the efficacy of a tumour vaccine by inhibiting the induction of Treg cells. We found that RA significantly enhanced TGF-Î²-induced expression of Foxp3 on naÃ¯ve and committed T cells in vitro and that this was blocked by an antagonist of RARÎ± (RARi). In addition, RARi significantly suppressed TGF-Î² and IL-10 and enhanced IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DC) in response to killed tumour cells or TLR agonists. Furthermore, RARi augmented the efficacy of an antigen-pulsed and TLR-activated DC vaccine, significantly attenuating growth of B16 tumours in vivo and enhancing survival of mice. This protective effect was associated with significant reduction in tumour-infiltrating FoxP3(+) and IL-10(+) Treg cells and a corresponding increase in tumour-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that secreted IFN-Î³. Our findings demonstrate that RARÎ± is an important target for the development of effective anti-tumour immunotherapeutics and for improving the efficacy of cancer vaccines. SH-SY5Y, control, and Parkinson's disease (PD) cybrids prepared from an Indian population were differentiated using retinoic acid (RA) for understanding their dopaminergic characteristics and neuritogenesis. Undifferentiated control and PD cybrids exhibited higher levels of TH mRNA, but lower c-RET expression, short neurites, low neuritic density, and low proportion of cells with neurites compared with the undifferentiated parent cell line, SH-SY5Y. The expression levels of DAT and Ptx3 were similar to SH-SY5Y. PD cybrids showed poor viability and lower differentiating potency than SH-SY5Y or control cybrids. RA treatment for 6 days elevated c-RET expression and corrected the neuritic morphology of the control, but not of PD cybrids. Cell viability was found to be reduced in differentiated control and PD cybrids. TH expression level was significantly elevated in SH-SY5Y following RA treatment, but not in both the cybrids. In differentiated control and PD cybrids, the TH immunofluorescence intensity was significantly lower compared with SH-SY5Y cells. MitoTracker Green fluorescence intensity of the mitochondria was higher in differentiated PD cybrids. Dopamine released into the medium was unaffected in the differentiated SH-SY5Y or in the control cybrids but was significantly elevated in PD cybrids. These results suggest that PD cybrids, differentiated or undifferentiated, maintained morphological and biochemical phenotypes significantly different from those of the control cybrids, or the differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and therefore could be an ideal cellular model of the disease for pharmacological screening of drugs and for investigation of the pathophysiology of PD. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic periodontitis (CP) are chronic inflammatory conditions and share many pathologic features. The common molecular pathogenesis of the two inflammatory diseases is unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate serum protein profiles specific for patients with RA and CP by a comprehensive proteomic analysis. The study participants were: 10 patients with RA, 10 patients with CP, 10 patients with RA and CP, and 10 healthy controls. All groups were balanced for age, sex, and smoking status. Serum protein spot volume was examined with two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins with significant differences in abundance among the four groups were determined with computer image analysis and identified with mass spectrometry and protein databases. A total of 1,694 protein spots were obtained in sera of the four groups. Seven spots were significantly different in abundance among the four groups. Of these, three spots (complement component 3, complement factor H, and ceruloplasmin) were significantly different in the RA+CP group compared with the other three groups (P <0.05). The similar profiles of complement component 3, complement factor H, and ceruloplasmin were observed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results suggest that patients with RA and CP may exhibit three serum proteins with different abundance compared with healthy controls and patients with RA only or CP only. The mitosis-meiosis switch is a key event in the differentiation of germ cells. Meiosis is important in development biology, however, it has not been clear what is the regulation mechanism in mammals. Our previous study showed that Boule could activate Stra8 directly and result in the meiosis initiation of dairy goat male germline stem cells (mGSCs). Nanos2, a RNA-binding protein, plays critical roles in the suppression of meiosis by preventing Stra8 expression and maintain the male germ cell development. The main purpose of this study was to explore whether Nanos2 represses Stra8 transcription through Boule or not. We found ectopic over-expression of Nanos2 in GC-1 and mGSCs down-regulated Stra8 transcription and translation, and Boule expression was not affected. It was in consistent with our expectation that RA could up-regulate Boule and Stra8 expression, but down-regulate Nanos2 expression in mGSCs. In dairy goat, the expression levels of Boule and Stra8 would rise with the increase of age, but the expression level of Nanos2 in 90 dpp and adult testis had not shown a clear change. In conclusion, Nanos2 represses Stra8 expression but not through Boule in dairy goat mGSCs. Retinoid receptors (RRs) play a key role in cell proliferation and differentiation. We characterized the expression of RA receptors and retinoid X receptors (RARs and RXRs) in a series of 111 thyroid tumors and investigated the mechanisms responsible for their deregulation: hypermethylation of the RARB2 promoter, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the regions of RARB and RXRA, and altered expression of CRBP1 and enzymes involved in RA biosynthesis (RDH10 and RALDH2). Expression of RALDH2 and RDH10 was conserved in 100 % of adenomas and in 90 and 98 %, respectively, of carcinomas, whereas staining for CRBP1 was decreased in 9 % of FAs and 28 % of carcinomas, mainly anaplastic carcinomas (55 %). We found an abnormal expression of RARA, RARB, RXRA, and RXRB in 67, 69, 66, and 73 %, respectively, of thyroid carcinomas (nâ=â78) and in 9, 9, 9, and 33 % of follicular adenomas (nâ=â33) (pâ<â0.001). An abnormal staining pattern of at least two of these markers had 90 % sensitivity and 91 % specificity for a diagnosis of malignancy. Promoter hypermethylation of RARB2 was observed in some anaplastic carcinomas (14 %). LOH was found to be common at the RARB locus (3p24-3p25) and the RXRA locus (9q34), respectively, in 44 and 55 % of carcinomas and in 27 and 43 % of adenomas. In conclusion, immunohistochemical staining for RARs and RXRs may help in the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated carcinoma and follicular adenoma. Further investigation should be carried out to determine whether the characterization of RR expression might identify patients who could benefit from therapy with RA derivatives. Retinoic acid (RA), an active derivative of the liposoluble vitamin A (retinol), acts as an important signaling molecule during embryonic development, regulating phenomenons as diverse as anterior-posterior axial patterning, forebrain and optic vesicle development, specification of hindbrain rhombomeres, pharyngeal arches and second heart field, somitogenesis, and differentiation of spinal cord neurons. This small molecule directly triggers gene activation by binding to nuclear receptors (RARs), switching them from potential repressors to transcriptional activators. The repertoire of RA-regulated genes in embryonic tissues is poorly characterized. We performed a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of murine wild-type and Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 null-mutant (Raldh2 (-/-)) embryos - unable to synthesize RA from maternally-derived retinol - using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed in two embryonic regions: anterior tissues including forebrain and optic vesicle, and posterior (trunk) tissues, at early stages preceding the appearance of overt phenotypic abnormalities. Several genes expected to be downregulated under RA deficiency appeared in the transcriptome data (e.g. Emx2, Foxg1 anteriorly, Cdx1, Hoxa1, Rarb posteriorly), whereas reverse-transcriptase-PCR and in situ hybridization performed for additional selected genes validated the changes identified through microarray analysis. Altogether, the affected genes belonged to numerous molecular pathways and cellular/organismal functions, demonstrating the pleiotropic nature of RA-dependent events. In both tissue samples, genes upregulated were more numerous than those downregulated, probably due to feedback regulatory loops. Bioinformatic analyses highlighted groups (clusters) of genes displaying similar behaviors in mutant tissues, and biological functions most significantly affected (e.g. mTOR, VEGF, ILK signaling in forebrain tissues; pyrimidine and purine metabolism, calcium signaling, one carbon metabolism in posterior tissues). Overall, these data give an overview of the gene expression changes resulting from embryonic RA deficiency, and provide new candidate genes and pathways that may help understanding retinoid-dependent molecular events. The aim of this study was to explore the role of vitamin D in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis by investigating the enrichment of vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in confirmed RA susceptibility loci and testing variants associated with vitamin D levels for association with RA. Bioinformatically, VDRE genomic positions were overlaid with non-HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-confirmed RA susceptibility regions. The number of VDREs at RA loci was compared to a randomly selected set of genomic loci to calculate an average relative risk (RR). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7/NADSYN1 (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthase 1) and CYP2R1 loci, previously associated with circulating vitamin D levels, were tested in UK RA cases (n=3870) and controls (n=8430). Significant enrichment of VDREs was seen at RA loci (P=9.23 Ã 10(-8)) when regions were defined either by gene (RR 5.50) or position (RR 5.86). SNPs in the DHCR7/NADSYN1 locus showed evidence of positive association with RA, rs4944076 (P=0.008, odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.24). The significant enrichment of VDREs at RA-associated loci and the modest association of variants in loci-controlling levels of circulating vitamin D supports the hypothesis that vitamin D has a role in the development of RA. Microenvironment-based alterations in phenotypes of mast cells influence the susceptibility to anaphylaxis, yet the mechanisms underlying proper maturation of mast cells toward an anaphylaxis-sensitive phenotype are incompletely understood. Here we report that PLA2G3, a mammalian homolog of anaphylactic bee venom phospholipase A2, regulates this process. PLA2G3 secreted from mast cells is coupled with fibroblastic lipocalin-type PGD2 synthase (L-PGDS) to provide PGD2, which facilitates mast-cell maturation via PGD2 receptor DP1. Mice lacking PLA2G3, L-PGDS or DP1, mast cell-deficient mice reconstituted with PLA2G3-null or DP1-null mast cells, or mast cells cultured with L-PGDS-ablated fibroblasts exhibited impaired maturation and anaphylaxis of mast cells. Thus, we describe a lipid-driven PLA2G3-L-PGDS-DP1 loop that drives mast cell maturation. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) provides patterning information during vertebrate embryogenesis, but the mechanism through which RA influences limb development is unclear. During patterning of the limb proximodistal axis (upper limb to digits), avian studies suggest that a proximal RA signal generated in the trunk antagonizes a distal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal. However, mouse and zebrafish genetic studies suggest that loss of RA suppresses forelimb initiation. Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that limb proximodistal patterning is not RA dependent, thus indicating that RA-FGF antagonism does not occur along the proximodistal axis of the limb. Instead, our studies show that RA-FGF antagonism acts prior to limb budding along the anteroposterior axis of the trunk lateral plate mesoderm to provide a patterning cue that guides formation of the forelimb field. These findings reconcile disparate ideas regarding RA-FGF antagonism and provide insight into how endogenous RA programs the early embryo. Elevated cytokine levels are known to downregulate expression and suppress activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Cytokine-modulating therapeutic proteins (TPs) used in the treatment of inflammation or infection could reverse suppression, manifesting as TP-drug-drug interactions (TP-DDIs). A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to quantitatively predict the impact of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. Elevated simvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in virtual rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, following 100 pg/ml of IL-6, was comparable to observed clinical data (59 vs. 58%). In virtual bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, 500 pg/ml of IL-6 resulted in an increase in cyclosporine AUC, also in good agreement with the observed data (45 vs. 39%). In a different group of BMT patients treated with cyclosporine, the magnitude of interaction with IL-6 was underpredicted by threefold. The complexity of TP-DDIs highlights underlying pathophysiological factors to be considered, but these simulations provide valuable first steps toward predicting TP-DDI risk. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic painful and debilitating autoimmune disease. Although the outcome for patients with RA has improved markedly in the past decades, driven largely by the advent of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and updated management strategies, adequate disease control cannot be achieved in a substantial proportion of patients. Since RA is a syndrome with different biological subsets, DMARDs, with a novel mechanism of action, may represent a valuable addition to the current armamentarium. Tofacitinib is a novel synthetic DMARD that selectively inhibits Janus kinases (JAKs), particularly JAK1 and JAK3. This review describes the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib. Furthermore, the article summarizes and comments the drug's efficacy and safety profile in RA patients. The authors furthermore assess data derived from the FDA's RA development program. Tofacitinib is an oral synthetic DMARD displaying linear pharmacokinetics. Metabolism, primarily mediated by CYP3A4, accounts for 70% of the total clearance of the drug; the remaining 30% are renally excreted. Tofacitinib monotherapy, or in combination with traditional DMARDs, has demonstrated its efficacy while having an acceptable safety profile in RA patients who have responded inadequately to current DMARDs, including TNF antagonists. In view of its undetermined benefit to risk ratio, in the real-world population, tofacitinib should, for now, only be prescribed to selected patients. Maternal thyroxine (T4) plays an essential role in fetal brain development, and even mild and transitory deficits in free-T4 in pregnant women can produce irreversible neurological effects in their offspring. Women of childbearing age are daily exposed to mixtures of chemicals disrupting the thyroid gland function (TGFDs) through the diet, drinking water, air and pharmaceuticals, which has raised the highest concern for the potential additive or synergic effects on the development of mild hypothyroxinemia during early pregnancy. Recently we demonstrated that zebrafish eleutheroembryos provide a suitable alternative model for screening chemicals impairing the thyroid hormone synthesis. The present study used the intrafollicular T4-content (IT4C) of zebrafish eleutheroembryos as integrative endpoint for testing the hypotheses that the effect of mixtures of TGFDs with a similar mode of action [inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)] was well predicted by a concentration addition concept (CA) model, whereas the response addition concept (RA) model predicted better the effect of dissimilarly acting binary mixtures of TGFDs [TPO-inhibitors and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)-inhibitors]. However, CA model provided better prediction of joint effects than RA in five out of the six tested mixtures. The exception being the mixture MMI (TPO-inhibitor)-KClO4 (NIS-inhibitor) dosed at a fixed ratio of EC10 that provided similar CA and RA predictions and hence it was difficult to get any conclusive result. There results support the phenomenological similarity criterion stating that the concept of concentration addition could be extended to mixture constituents having common apical endpoints or common adverse outcomes. Retinoic acid is an embryonic morphogen and dietary factor that demonstrates chemotherapeutic efficacy in inducing maturation in leukemia cells. Using HL60 model human myeloid leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and p47(phox) expression. However, RA-treated RA-resistant HL60 continue to exhibit sustained MEK/ERK activation, and one of the two sequentially emergent resistant lines retains RA-inducible CD38 expression. Other signaling events that define the wild-type (WT) response are compromised, including c-Raf phosphorylation and increased expression of c-Cbl, Vav1, and the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr. As shown previously in WT HL60 cells, we found that the SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly increases G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, CD38 and CD11b expression, c-Raf phosphorylation and expression of the aforementioned regulators in RA-resistant HL60. The resistant cells were potentially incapable of developing inducible oxidative metabolism. These results motivate the concept that RA resistance can occur in steps, wherein growth arrest and other differentiation events may be recovered in both emergent lines. Investigating the mechanistic anomalies in resistant cell lines is of therapeutic significance and helps to mechanistically understand the response to retinoic acid's biological effects in WT HL60 cells. Retinoic acid (RA), plays an essential role in the growth and patterning of vertebrate limb. While the developmental processes regulated by RA are well understood, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms required to precisely control limb RA synthesis. Here, Aldh1a2 functions as the primary enzyme necessary for RA production which regulates forelimb outgrowth and hindlimb digit separation. Because mice lacking HOXA13 exhibit similar defects in digit separation as Aldh1a2 mutants, we hypothesized that HOXA13 regulates Aldh1a2 to facilitate RA-mediated interdigital programmed cell death (IPCD) and digit separation. In this report, we identify Aldh1a2 as a direct target of HOXA13. In absence of HOXA13 function, Aldh1a2 expression, RA signaling, and IPCD are reduced. In the limb, HOXA13 binds a conserved cis-regulatory element in the Aldh1a2 locus that can be regulated by HOXA13 to promote gene expression. Finally, decreased RA signaling and IPCD can be partially rescued in the Hoxa13 mutant hindlimb by maternal RA supplementation. Defects in IPCD and digit separation in Hoxa13 mutant mice may be caused in part by reduced levels of RA signaling stemming from a loss in the direct regulation of Aldh1a2. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional regulation of RA signaling necessary for limb morphogenesis. C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) have been associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) events in non-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) populations. We investigated potential associations of MTHFR polymorphisms and use of methotrexate (MTX) with time-to-CV event in data from the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry. VARA participants were genotyped for MTHFR polymorphisms. Variables included demographic information, baseline comorbidities, RA duration, autoantibody status, and disease activity. Patients' comorbidities and outcome variables were defined using International Classification of Diseases-9 and Current Procedural Terminology codes. The combined CV event outcome included myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the time-to-CV event. Data were available for 1047 subjects. Post-enrollment CV events occurred in 97 patients (9.26%). Although there was a trend toward reduced risk of CV events, MTHFR polymorphisms were not significantly associated with time-to-CV event. Time-to-CV event was associated with prior stroke (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.03-3.90), prior MI (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06-2.71), hyperlipidemia (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01-2.43), and increased modified Charlson-Deyo index (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13-1.34). MTX use (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.99) and increasing education (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95) were associated with a lower risk for CV events. Although MTHFR polymorphisms were previously associated with CV events in non-RA populations, we found only a trend toward decreased association with CV events in RA. Traditional risk factors conferred substantial CV risk, while MTX use and increasing years of education were protective. Gene activation of HOX clusters is an early event in embryonic development. These genes are highly expressed and active in the vertebrate nervous system. Based on the presence of retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory region of many of the HOX genes, it is deduced that retinoic acid (RA) can influence epigenetic regulation and consequently the expression pattern of HOX during RA-induced differentiation of embryonic model systems. In this investigation, the expression level as well as the epigenetic regulation of several HOX genes of the 4 A-D clusters was analyzed in human embryonic stem cells, and also through their neural induction, in the presence and absence of RA. Expression analysis data significantly showed increased mRNA levels of all examined HOX genes in the presence of RA. Epigenetic analysis of the HOX gene regulatory regions also showed a significant decrease in methylation of histone H3K27 parallel to an absolute preferential incorporation of the demethylase UTX rather than JMJD3 in RA-induced neural differentiated cells. This finding clearly showed the functional role of UTX in epigenetic alteration of HOX clusters during RA-induced neural differentiation; the activity could not be detectable for the demethylase JMJD3 during this developmental process. The use of paramagnetic NMR data for the refinement of structures of proteins and protein complexes is widespread. However, the power of paramagnetism for protein assignment has not yet been fully exploited. PARAssign is software that uses pseudocontact shift data derived from several paramagnetic centers attached to the protein to obtain amide and methyl assignments. The ability of PARAssign to perform assignment when the positions of the paramagnetic centers are known and unknown is demonstrated. PARAssign has been tested using synthetic data for methyl assignment of a 47 kDa protein, and using both synthetic and experimental data for amide assignment of a 14 kDa protein. The complex fitting space involved in such an assignment procedure necessitates that good starting conditions are found, both regarding placement and strength of paramagnetic centers. These starting conditions are obtained through automated tensor placement and user-defined tensor parameters. The results presented herein demonstrate that PARAssign is able to successfully perform resonance assignment in large systems with a high degree of reliability. This software provides a method for obtaining the assignments of large systems, which may previously have been unassignable, by using 2D NMR spectral data and a known protein structure. More than 70% of breast cancers in women require estrogens for cell proliferation and survival. 17Î²-estradiol (E2) effect on mammary target cells is almost exclusively mediated by its binding to the estrogen receptor-Î± (ERÎ±) that joins chromatin where it assembles active transcription complexes. The proliferative and pro-survival action of estrogens is antagonized in most cases by retinoic acid (RA), even though the cognate retinoic acid receptor-Î± (RARÎ±) cooperates with ERÎ± on promoters of estrogen-responsive genes. We have examined at the molecular level the crosstalk between these nuclear receptors from the point of view of their control of cell growth and show here that RA reverts estrogen-stimulated transcription of the pivotal anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene by preventing demethylation of dimethyl lysine 9 in histone H3 (HeK9me2). As we previously reported, this is obtained by means of E2-triggered activation of the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enzyme that manages chromatin plasticity in order to allow specific movements of chromosomal regions within the nucleus. We find that E2 fuels LSD1 by inducing migration of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) into the nucleus, where it targets estrogen-responsive loci. RA rescues LSD1-dependent disappearance of H3K9me2 at bcl-2 regulatory regions upon the prevention of PKA assembly to the same sites. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the interaction of multiple mediators, among the most important of which are cytokines. In recent years, extensive studies demonstrate a pivotal role for one cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), in fundamental events in innate and adaptive immunity. MIF has now been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, but in the case of RA the evidence for a role of MIF is very strong. MIF is abundantly expressed in the sera of RA patients and in RA synovial tissue correlating with disease activity. MIF-deficient mice were used to induce arthritis by serum transfer from K/BxN mice. K/BxN serum transfer arthritis was markedly attenuated in MIF(-) mice, with reduction in clinical index and histological severity as well as decrease in synovial cytokines. Macrophage transfers were done to investigate the specific role of macrophage-derived MIF. We show that adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophages into MIF(-) mice restores the sensitivity of MIF(-) mice to arthritis development, and this affect was associated with a restoration in serum IL-1Î² and IL-6 production. These results indicate that MIF plays a critical role in inflammation and joint destruction in K/BxN serum-induced arthritis and that the systemic expression of MIF by a subpopulation of macrophages is necessary and sufficient for the full development of arthritis.
